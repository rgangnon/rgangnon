    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>I am a Professor in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics</a> and the 
<a href="https://pophealth.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Population Health Sciences</a> in the 
<a href="https://med.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Medicine and Public Health</a> at the 
<a href="https://wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I have an affiliate appointment in the 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in 
<a href="https://www.visitduluth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. I graduated from 
<a href="https://www.isd709.org/duluth-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East High School</a> in 1988. I received a BA in 
<a href="https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/departments-and-programs/mathematics-statistics-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics</a> and 
<a href="https://lsbe.d.umn.edu/about/academic-departments/economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economics</a> in 1992 from the 
<a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Minnesota-Duluth</a> and an 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/ms-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MS in Statistics</a> in 1994 and a 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhD in Statistics with emphasis in Biostatistics</a> in 1998 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My PhD advisor was 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/clayton-murray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murray Clayton</a>.</p>
<p>I was a research scientist in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/research/clinical-trials/statistical-data-analysis-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistical Data Analysis Center(SDAC)</a> in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1998-2005.  I joined the faculty with a joint appointment in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics</a> and the 
<a href="https://pophealth.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Population Health Sciences</a> in 2005.</p>
<p>I am an applied biostatistician focusing on problems in clinical and epidemiologic research. Current methodologic areas of interest include (1) multi-state models for incidence, progression and regression of ocular (and other) diseases, (2) small area estimation problems, particularly ranking, (3) spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, particularly cluster detection and high-dimensional variable selection and (4) age-period-cohort modeling.</p>

    <a href="/publication/jewett-2019/">Optimal Bayesian point estimates and credible intervals for ranking with application to county health indices</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>It is fairly common to rank different geographic units, e.g. counties in the USA, based on health indices. In a typical application, point estimates of the health indices are obtained for each county, and the indices are then simply ranked as if they were known constants. Several authors have considered optimal rank estimators under squared error loss on the rank scale as a default method for general purpose ranking, e.g. situations where ranking units across the full spectrum of performance (low, medium, high) is important. While computationally convenient, squared error loss on the rank scale may not represent the true inferential goals of rank consumers. We construct alternative loss functions based on three components: (1) the inferential goal (rank position or pairwise comparisons), (2) the scale (original, log-transformed or rank) and (3) the (positional or pairwise) loss function (0/1, squared error or absolute error). We can obtain optimal ranks for loss functions based on rank positions and nearly optimal ranks for loss functions based on pairwise comparisons paired with highest posterior density (HPD) credible intervals. We compare inferences produced by the various ranking methods, both optimal and heuristic, using low birth weight data for counties in the Midwestern United States, from 2006 to 2012.</p>

    <a href="/publication/gangnon-2018/">Contribution of Breast Cancer to Overall Mortality for US Women</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>OBJECTIVE:
Breast cancer simulation models must take changing mortality rates into account to evaluate the potential impact of cancer control interventions. We estimated mortality rates due to breast cancer and all other causes combined to determine their impact on overall mortality by year, age, and birth cohort. METHODS:
Based on mortality rates from publicly available datasets, an age-period-cohort model was used to estimate the proportion of deaths due to breast cancer for US women aged 0 to 119 years, with birth years 1900 to 2000. Breast cancer mortality was calculated as all-cause mortality multiplied by the proportion of deaths due to breast cancer; other-cause mortality was the difference between all-cause and breast cancer mortality. RESULTS:
Breast cancer and other-cause mortality rates were higher for older ages and birth cohorts. The percent of deaths due to breast cancer increased across birth cohorts from 1900 to 1940 then decreased. Among 50-year-old women, in the 1920 birth cohort, 52 (9.9%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 9.8% to 10.1%) were attributed to breast cancer whereas 476 of 100,000 were due to other causes; in the 1960 birth cohort, 22 (8.5%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 8.3% to 8.7%) were attributed to breast cancer with 242 of 100,000 deaths due to other causes. The percentage of all deaths due to breast cancer was highest (4.1% to 12.9%) for women in their 40s and 50s for all birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS:
This study offers evidence that advances in breast cancer screening and treatment have reduced breast cancer mortality for women across the age spectrum, and provides estimates of age-, year- and birth cohort-specific competing mortality rates for simulation models. Other-cause mortality estimates are important in these models because most women die from causes other than breast cancer.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>PURPOSE:
To assess the association between geographic access to mammography facilities and women&rsquo;s mammography utilization frequency. METHODS:
Using data from the population-based 1995-2007 Wisconsin Women&rsquo;s Health study, we used proportional odds and logistic regression to test whether driving times to mammography facilities and the number of mammography facilities within 10 km of women&rsquo;s homes were associated with mammography frequency among women aged 50-74 years and whether associations differed between Rural-Urban Commuting Areas and income and education groups. RESULTS:
We found evidence for nonlinear relationships between geographic access and mammography utilization (nonlinear effects of driving times and facility density, P-values .01 and .005, respectively). Having at least one nearby mammography facility was associated with greater mammography frequency among urban women (1 vs. 0 facilities, odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.47), with similar effects among rural women. Adding more facilities had decreasing marginal effects. Long driving times tended to be associated with lower mammography frequency. We found no effect modification by income, education, or urbanicity. In rural settings, mammography nonuse was higher, facility density smaller, and driving times to facilities were longer. CONCLUSIONS:
Having at least one mammography facility near one&rsquo;s home may increase mammography utilization, with decreasing effects per each additional facility.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>PURPOSE:
To develop a composite Cancer Burden Index and produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of uncertainties for the index. METHODS:
The Kentucky Cancer Registry has developed a cancer burden Rank Sum Index (RSI) to guide statewide comprehensive cancer control activities. However, lack of interval estimates for RSI limits its applications. RSI also weights individual measures with little inherent variability equally as ones with large variability. To address these issues, a Modified Sum Index (MSI) was developed to take into account of magnitudes of observed values. A simulation approach was used to generate individual and simultaneous 95% CIs for the rank MSI. An uncertainty measure was also calculated. RESULTS:
At the Area Development Districts (ADDs) level, the ranks of the RSI and the MSI were almost identical, while larger variation was found at the county level. The widths of the CIs at the ADD level were considerably shorter than those at the county level. CONCLUSION:
The measures developed for estimating composite cancer burden indices and the simulated CIs provide valuable information to guide cancer prevention and control effort. Caution should be taken when interpreting ranks from small population geographic units where the CIs for the ranks overlap considerably.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Spatial cluster detection is an important problem in a variety of scientific disciplines such as environmental sciences,epidemiology and sociology. However, there appears to be very limited statistical methodology for quantifying theuncertainty of a detected cluster. In this paper, we develop a new method for the quantification and visualizationof uncertainty associated with a detected cluster. Our approach is defining a confidence set for the true cluster andvisualizing the confidence set, based on the maximum likelihood, in time or in one-dimensional space. We evaluatethe pivotal property of the statistic used to construct the confidence set and the coverage rate for the true clustervia empirical distributions. For illustration, our methodology is applied to both simulated data and an Alaska borealforest dataset</p>

    <a href="/publication/ober-2020/">Expression quantitative trait locus fine mapping of the 17q12–21 asthma locus in African American children: a genetic association and gene expression study</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Background: African ancestry is associated with a higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma than European ancestries, yet genetic studies of the most common locus associated with childhood-onset asthma, 17q12-21, in African Americans have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to leverage both the phenotyping of the Children&rsquo;s Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) birth cohort consortium, and the reduced linkage disequilibrium in African Americans, to fine map the 17q12-21 locus.
Methods: We first did a genetic association study and meta-analysis using 17q12-21 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for childhood-onset asthma in 1613 European American and 870 African American children from the CREW consortium. Nine tag SNPs were selected based on linkage disequilibrium patterns at 17q12-21 and their association with asthma, considering the effect allele under an additive model (0, 1, or 2 effect alleles). Results were meta-analysed with publicly available summary data from the EVE consortium (on 4303 European American and 3034 African American individuals) for seven of the nine SNPs of interest. Subsequently, we tested for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among the SNPs associated with childhood-onset asthma and the expression of 17q12-21 genes in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 85 African American CREW children and in upper airway epithelial cells from 246 African American CREW children; and in lower airway epithelial cells from 44 European American and 72 African American adults from a case-control study of asthma genetic risk in Chicago (IL, USA).
Findings: 17q12-21 SNPs were broadly associated with asthma in European Americans. Only two SNPs (rs2305480 in gasdermin-B [GSDMB] and rs8076131 in ORMDL sphingolipid biosynthesis regulator 3 [ORMDL3]) were associated with asthma in African Americans, at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p&lt;0·0055 (for rs2305480_G, odds ratio [OR] 1·36 [95% CI 1·12-1·65], p=0·0014; and for rs8076131_A, OR 1·37 [1·13-1·67], p=0·0010). In upper airway epithelial cells from African American children, genotype at rs2305480 was the most significant eQTL for GSDMB (eQTL effect size [β] 1·35 [95% CI 1·25-1·46], p&lt;0·0001), and to a lesser extent showed an eQTL effect for post-GPI attachment to proteins phospholipase 3 (β 1·15 [1·08-1·22], p&lt;0·0001). No SNPs were eQTLs for ORMDL3. By contrast, in PBMCs, the five core SNPs were associated only with expression of GSDMB and ORMDL3. Genotype at rs12936231 (in zona pellucida binding protein 2) showed the strongest associations across both genes (for GSDMB, eQTLβ 1·24 [1·15-1·32], p&lt;0·0001; and for ORMDL3 (β 1·19 [1·12-1·24], p&lt;0·0001). The eQTL effects of rs2305480 on GSDMB expression were replicated in lower airway cells from African American adults (β 1·29 [1·15-1·44], p&lt;0·0001).
Interpretation: Our study suggests that SNPs regulating GSDMB expression in airway epithelial cells have a major role in childhood-onset asthma, whereas SNPs regulating the expression levels of 17q12-21 genes in resting blood cells are not central to asthma risk. Our genetic and gene expression data in African Americans and European Americans indicated GSDMB to be the leading candidate gene at this important asthma locus.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Maternal depression is a risk factor for the development of problem behavior in children. Although food insecurity and housing instability are associated with adult depression and child behavior, how these economic factors mediate or moderate the relationship between maternal depression and child problem behavior is not understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether food insecurity and housing instability are mediators and/or moderators of the relationship between maternal depression when a child is age 3 and children&rsquo;s problem behaviors at age 9 and to determine whether these mechanisms differ by race/ethnicity. We used the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Food insecurity and housing instability at age 5 were tested as potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between maternal depression status at age 3 and child problem behavior at age 9. A path analysis confirmed our hypothesis that food insecurity and housing instability partially mediate the relationship between maternal depression when the child is age 3 and children’s problem behavior at age 9. However, housing instability was only a mediator for externalizing problem behavior and not internalizing problem behavior or overall problem behavior. Results of the moderation analysis suggest that neither food insecurity nor housing instability were moderators. None of the mechanisms explored differed by race/ethnicity. While our findings stress the continued need for interventions that address child food insecurity, they emphasize the importance of interventions that address maternal mental health throughout a child&rsquo;s life. Given the central role of maternal health in child development, additional efforts should be made to target maternal depression, during and following the perinatal period.</p>

    <a href="/publication/schmidt-2020/">Bicycling Rates and the Prevalence of Bicycle Helmet Usage in the State of Wisconsin</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Introduction: Bicycles are a source of transportation, recreation, and exercise throughout the world.  Bicycling is associated with both health and environmental benefits, but also poses a risk of injury. The use of bicycle helmets has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cycling. It is unknown if helmet use differs across Wisconsin geographic areas and socio-demographic groups.
Methods: Data were obtained from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW).  Bicycle use and helmet use frequency were determined from a self-administered questionnaire that contained questions specific to preventative health behaviors.  Descriptive statistics summarized overall bicycle ridership. Chi-Square and Student’s t-tests were performed to assess relationships between bicycle and helmet use across geographic categories and socio-demographic groups.
Results: Differences between sex, race or ethnicity, and education level were found to be associated with bicycle ridership and the frequency of helmet use.  Men were significantly more likely to report riding a bicycle and never wearing a helmet.  Individuals from urban communities reported always wearing a helmet more often than rural communities.  Higher education levels were associated with higher levels of bicycle and helmet use.  Race or ethnicity was not associated with bicycle ridership, but was associated with differences in helmet use frequency.
Conclusion: Nearly half of those who ride bicycles in Wisconsin report never wearing a helmet.  Since bicycle ridership and helmet use were found to be associated with a number of socio-demographic characteristics, any solution should consider the role of equity when attempting to increase ridership or helmet use.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Introduction.  Translating complex behavior change interventions into practice can be accompanied by a loss of fidelity and effectiveness.  We present the evaluation of two sequential phases of implementation of a complex evidence-based community workshop to reduce falls, using the Replicating Effective Programs Framework.. Between the two phases, the workshop training and delivery were revised to improve fidelity with key elements. . Methods. Stepping On program participants completed a questionnaire at baseline (Phase 1: n=361, Phase 2: n=2219) and 6 months post workshop (Phase 1: n=232, Phase 2: n=1281). Phase 2 participants had an additional follow up at 12 months (n=883). Outcomes were the number of falls in the prior 6 months and the falls behavioral risk (FaB) score. Results. Workshop participation in Phase 1 was associated with a 6% reduction in falls (RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.74, 1.20) and a 0.14 improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.11- 0.18) at 6 months. Workshop participation in Phase 2 was associated with a 38% reduction in falls (RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.68), and a 0.16 improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.14-0.18) at 6 months, and a 28% reduction in falls (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.80) and a 0.19 score improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.17-0.21) at 12 months follow-up. Conclusions:  Effectiveness can be maintained with widespread dissemination of a complex behavior change intervention if attention is paid to fidelity of key elements. An essential role for implementation science is to ensure effectiveness as programs transition from research to practice.</p>
