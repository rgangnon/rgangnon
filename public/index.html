    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <p>I am a Professor in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics</a> and the 
<a href="https://pophealth.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Population Health Sciences</a> in the 
<a href="https://med.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">School of Medicine and Public Health</a> at the 
<a href="https://wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>. I have an affiliate appointment in the 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in 
<a href="https://www.visitduluth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duluth, Minnesota</a>. I graduated from 
<a href="https://www.isd709.org/duluth-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener">East High School</a> in 1988. I received a BA in 
<a href="https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/departments-and-programs/mathematics-statistics-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics</a> and 
<a href="https://lsbe.d.umn.edu/about/academic-departments/economics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Economics</a> in 1992 from the 
<a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Minnesota-Duluth</a> and an 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/ms-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MS in Statistics</a> in 1994 and a 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhD in Statistics with emphasis in Biostatistics</a> in 1998 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My PhD advisor was 
<a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/clayton-murray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Murray Clayton</a>.</p>
<p>I was a research scientist in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/research/clinical-trials/statistical-data-analysis-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statistical Data Analysis Center(SDAC)</a> in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1998-2005.  I joined the faculty with a joint appointment in the 
<a href="https://biostat.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics</a> and the 
<a href="https://pophealth.wisc.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Population Health Sciences</a> in 2005.</p>
<p>I am an applied biostatistician focusing on problems in clinical and epidemiologic research. Current methodologic areas of interest include (1) multi-state models for incidence, progression and regression of ocular (and other) diseases, (2) small area estimation problems, particularly ranking, (3) spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, particularly cluster detection and high-dimensional variable selection and (4) age-period-cohort modeling.</p>
<p>Outside of the office, I&rsquo;m an avid cyclist. You can check out my recent rides on 
<a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/30109438" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strava</a>.  I&rsquo;m also a big movie fan. You&rsquo;ll definitely see me at the 
<a href="https://wifilmfest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wisconsin Film Festival</a>, one of my favorite events every year, and you can see lists of my favorite films and what I&rsquo;ve been watching recently on

    <a href="/publication/weeks-2025/">Racial disparities in intrapartum care experiences and birth hospital characteristics</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Policymakers and researchers have posited intrapartum care as a potential mediator of racial inequities in perinatal outcomes. However, few studies have measured patient-centered quality of intrapartum care or explored differences by race. To address this gap, we developed a survey supplement using cognitive interviewing and administered it to a probability-based race-stratified random sample of people who recently gave birth in Wisconsin in 2020, including oversamples of non-Hispanic Black and Indigenous birthing people. We estimate overall and race-specific prevalences of intrapartum care experiences and use survey-weighted mixed effects ordinal and logistic regression to estimate differences in intrapartum care experiences by race/ethnicity and hospital characteristics. We find significant racial differences in the population prevalence of negative experiences of intrapartum care providers, including disrespect, lack of responsiveness, inclusion in decision-making about care, and pressure to use epidural analgesia. In unadjusted models, both non-Hispanic Indigenous (American Indian/Alaska Native) and non-Hispanic Black respondents had higher odds (than non-Hispanic White birthing people) of reporting several negative intrapartum experiences, including feeling disrespected by providers and experiencing a lower level of care team responsiveness. In adjusted models, Indigenous respondents had significantly higher odds of reporting that intrapartum care providers withheld information, showed disrespect, and were less responsive. Giving birth at a low birth-volume hospital was associated with higher odds of reporting greater participation in decision-making.</p>

    <a href="/publication/kamenetsky-2024/">The Role of Neighborhood in Individual and Disparity-Level Factors and Birth Weight in Dane County, Wisconsin</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Introduction: There are significant disparities in the rates of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in the United States – a discrepancy of particular importance in Wisconsin, where Non-Hispanic Black women experience the highest mortality rates in the country. The adverse effects of neighborhood socioeconomic status and geographical distance to obstetrical care outcomes have been demonstrated previously, with poor neighborhood socioeconomic status having been linked to higher rates of preterm births and low birth weight infants, which both increase the risk of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of Area Deprivation Index and geographic location on age-matched birth weight z-scores.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all singleton births &gt;22 weeks’ gestation in Dane County, Wisconsin, from January 2016 through June 2018. Generalized additive models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, cigarette use, delivery route, pregnancy-related or chronic hypertension, pregestational and gestational diabetes, number of prenatal visits, maternal age, total weight gain, and pre-pregnancy body mass index.
Results: There is evidence of an association between birth weight z-score and spatial location (median P value 0.006). With area deprivation, we found no evidence of an association with birth weight z-score (-0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.01; P = 0.109). Mean birth weight z-scores were lowest (-0.72) in the urban center of Madison, while mean birth weight z-score was highest (0.18) in rural areas near the northeast, southeast, and southwest county borders. We found an effect of race/ethnicity on birth weight.
Conclusions: We identified geographic variations in birth weight at a granular level using census block groups and a holistic measure of deprivation, which can inform targeted public health interventions. The lack of evidence of area deprivation on birth outcomes but significant spatial trends demonstrated continued geographic disparities in our health care systems.</p>

    <a href="/publication/pollock-2024/">Cluster Analysis Methods to Support Population Health Improvement among U.S. Counties</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Context: Population health rankings can be a catalyst for the improvement of health by drawing attention to areas in need of relative improvement and summarizing complex information in a manner understood by almost everyone. However, ranks also have unintended consequences, such as being interpreted as “hard truths”, where variations may not be significant. There is a need to improve communication about uncertainty in ranks, with accurate interpretation. The most common solutions discussed in the literature have included modeling approaches to minimize statistical noise or borrow strength from covariates. However, the use of complex models can limit communication and implementation, especially for broad audiences. Objectives: Explore data-informed grouping (cluster analysis) as an easier-to-understand, empirical technique to account for rank imprecision that can be effectively communicated both numerically and visually. Design: Cluster analysis, specifically k-means clustering with Wasserstein (earth mover’s) distance, was explored as an approach to identify natural and meaningful groupings and gaps in the data distribution for the County Health Rankings’ (CHR) health outcomes ranks. Setting: County-level health outcomes from the 2022 CHR Participants: 3,082 counties that were ranked in the 2022 CHR Main Outcome Measure: Data-informed health groups Results: Cluster analysis identified 30 health groupings among counties nationwide, with cluster size ranging from nine to 184 counties. On average, states had 16 identified clusters, ranging from 3 in Delaware and Hawaii to 27 in Virginia. Number of clusters per state was associated with number of counties per state and population of the state. The method helped address many of the issues that arise from providing rank estimates alone. Conclusions: Public health practitioners can use this information to understand uncertainty in ranks, visualize distances between county ranks, have context around which counties are not meaningfully different from one another, and compare county performance to peer counties.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Prior research has shown that cancer risk varies by geography, but scan statistic methods for identifying cancer clusters in case-control studies have been limited in their ability to identify multiple clusters and adjust for participant-level risk factors. We develop a method to identify geographic patterns of breast cancer odds using the Wisconsin Women&rsquo;s Health Study, a series of 5 population-based case-control studies of female Wisconsin residents aged 20-79 enrolled in 1988-2004 (cases=16,076, controls=16,795). We create sets of potential clusters by overlaying a 1 km grid over each county-neighborhood and enumerating a series of overlapping circles. Using a two-step approach, we fi=t a penalized binomial regression model to the number of cases and trials in each grid cell, penalizing all potential clusters by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). We use BIC to select the number of clusters, which are included in a participant-level logistic regression model. We identify 15 geographic clusters, resulting in 23 areas of unique geographic odds ratios. After adjustment for known risk factors, confidence intervals narrowed but breast cancer odds ratios did not meaningfully change; one additional hotspot was identified. By considering multiple overlapping spatial clusters simultaneously, we discern gradients of spatial odds across Wisconsin.</p>

  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection are important tools in public health and many other areas of application. Cluster detection can be approached as a multiple testing problem, typically using a space and time scan statistic. We recast the spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection problem in a high-dimensional data analytical framework with Poisson or quasi-Poisson regression with the Lasso penalty. We adopt a fast and computationally-efficient method using a novel sparse matrix representation of the effects of potential clusters. The number of clusters and tuning parameters are selected based on (quasi-)information criteria. We evaluate the performance of our proposed method including the false positive detection rate and power using a simulation study. Application of the method is illustrated using breast cancer incidence data from three prefectures in Japan.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Policymakers and researchers have posited intrapartum care as a potential mediator of racial inequities in perinatal outcomes. However, few studies have measured patient-centered quality of intrapartum care or explored differences by race. To address this gap, we developed a survey supplement using cognitive interviewing and administered it to a probability-based race-stratified random sample of people who recently gave birth in Wisconsin in 2020, including oversamples of non-Hispanic Black and Indigenous birthing people. We estimate overall and race-specific prevalences of intrapartum care experiences and use survey-weighted mixed effects ordinal and logistic regression to estimate differences in intrapartum care experiences by race/ethnicity and hospital characteristics. We find significant racial differences in the population prevalence of negative experiences of intrapartum care providers, including disrespect, lack of responsiveness, inclusion in decision-making about care, and pressure to use epidural analgesia. In unadjusted models, both non-Hispanic Indigenous (American Indian/Alaska Native) and non-Hispanic Black respondents had higher odds (than non-Hispanic White birthing people) of reporting several negative intrapartum experiences, including feeling disrespected by providers and experiencing a lower level of care team responsiveness. In adjusted models, Indigenous respondents had significantly higher odds of reporting that intrapartum care providers withheld information, showed disrespect, and were less responsive. Giving birth at a low birth-volume hospital was associated with higher odds of reporting greater participation in decision-making.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Air pollution is a pervasive environmental health hazard with the potential to worsen respiratory health outcomes, including asthma exacerbations. The impact of PM on asthma exacerbations among 2.5 rural populations is not well understood. Our analysis used a retrospective, time-stratified, case-crossover study design to examine the relationship be tween PM and asthma exacerbations. We included asthma exacerbations 2.5 that occurred January 1, 2019–June 30, 2022, among residents of seven ru ral counties in Wisconsin with a PM air monitor. We also used PM data 2.5 2.5 collected by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and weather data available from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Further, we used conditional logistic regression to assess the asso ciation between asthma exacerbations and lagged PM levels, adjusting for 2.5 maximum daily temperature. We found PM levels (µg/m3) 2 days prior to 2.5 exacerbation were significantly associated with asthma exacerbations (haz ard ratio 1.184; 95% confidence interval [1.051, 1.344]). Our study dem onstrated an increased hazard of asthma exacerbations with higher levels of PM in rural populations. These findings highlight the need for further 2.5 research and efforts to mitigate the effects of air pollution in rural areas.</p>

  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Background and aims Multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic health conditions, is a growing problem in the United States and abroad. Physical activity is a modifiable health behavior that promotes physical and mental health, yet little is known about the relationship between physical activity and mental health among those with multimorbidity. Methods Using a population-based survey of community dwelling adults in Wisconsin, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), we assessed the relationship between accelerometer-measured physical activity and self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with and without multimorbidity. Results Participants with multimorbidity were significantly more likely to have moderate to extremely severe levels of anxiety than those without multimorbidity (17.2% vs 10.5%, p &lt; 0.001). One hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week was associated with decreased odds of anxiety of those with multimorbidity (0.86 [0.75, 0.99]). We also found a positive association between light intensity physical activity and a lower burden of depressive symptoms among those with one chronic condition (0.95 [0.93, 0.98]) or multimorbidity (0.97 [0.95, 1.00]), and lower odds of anxiety among those without chronic conditions (0.98 [0.95, 1.00]) or with only one chronic condition (0.95 [0.93, 0.98]). Conclusions Our study suggests that MVPA and light intensity physical activity may be associated with lower odds of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with and without multimorbidity. Further research is needed to identify populations, disease states, and condition clusters that may have the most potential benefit from light intensity activity and MVPA.</p>

    <a href="/publication/gilson-2025/">Older Adult Misuse of Over-the-Counter Medications: Effectiveness of a Novel Pharmacy-Based Intervention to Improve Patient Safety</a>
  </h3>

  
  <div class="article-style">
    <p>Objectives Older adults’ (ages ≥65) inappropriate over-the-counter medications (OTC) use is prevalent, comprising Drug-Age, Drug-Drug, Drug-Disease, and Drug-Label types. Given that pharmacies sell many OTCs, structurally redesigning pharmacy aisles for improving patient safety (Senior Safe) was conceived to mitigate older adult OTC misuse, using Stop Signs and Behind-the-Counter Signs for high-risk OTCs. This study determined whether Senior Safe reduced high-risk OTCs misuse, while secondarily evaluating misuse changes for all OTCs.
Methods A randomized controlled trial design matched and randomly allocated 20 health system community pharmacies to control or intervention groups. All 288 study participants completed an OTC choice task in which they chose a hypothetical symptom scenario (pain, sleep, cough/cold/allergy), selected an OTC, and described how they would use it at symptom onset and if symptoms persisted or worsened. Reported OTC use was evaluated for each misuse type. Intervention and control sites were compared for each misuse type using multivariate modeling.
Results For high-risk OTCs, Drug-Age and Drug-Drug misuse were more likely in control sites (OR = 2.752, P = 0.004; OR = 6.199, P = 0.003, respectively), whereas Drug-Disease and Drug-Label misuse had too few occurrences in intervention sites for statistical comparisons. For all OTCs, only Drug-Age misuse was more likely for control sites (OR = 5.120, P = 0.001). Adults aged 85+ years had the greatest likelihood of all misuse types.
Conclusions Results demonstrated that older adults frequently reported multiple misuse types, highlighting safety concerns. Senior Safe reduced high-risk OTC misuse, especially for older adults younger than 85 years. Cumulatively, these findings provide insights into practice recommendations supported through regulatory guidance.</p>
