However, the association of physical activity (PA) across the lifespan on mortality risk among endometrial cancer survivors is understudied. The study’s objective was to identify the association of lifetime PA on mortality risk in endometrial cancer survivors. Methods Seven hundred forty-five endometrial cancer survivors drawn from a population-based cancer registry (diagnosed between 1991 and 1994) reported the frequency (sessions/week) of moderate- and vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) at age 12, age 20, and 5 years pre-interview (post-diagnosis). Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for the association between PA, all-cause, and cardiovascular disease mortality as assessed in 2016. MVPA was modeled using natural cubic splines. Results Diagnosis age, body mass index, and smoking (pack-years) were each positively associated with increased all-cause mortality risk. Those who did one session of MVPA 5 years pre-interview had a lower mortality risk (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41–0.92) compared to those with no MVPA. Those reporting one session of MVPA was similarly observed at age 12 (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.86–1.06) and at age 20 (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.65–1.16). Conclusion Those who participated in PA, compared to those who did not, in the 5 years before diagnosis had a lower mortality risk. While PA was not independently protective against mortality risk at ages 12 or 20, PA is still important for endometrial cancer survivors for other non-mortality outcomes.","tags":null,"title":"Mortality risk and physical activity across the lifespan in endometrial cancer survivors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maria Kamenetsky","Junho Lee","Jun Zhu","Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636675200,"objectID":"73cf562872c288d469d4bc71a814359c","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/kamenetsky-2021/","publishdate":"2021-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kamenetsky-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection are important tools in public health and many other areas of application.

Methods: Using publicly available datasets (CDC Wonder, Human Mortality Database), we developed an age-period-cohort model of breast cancer mortality and breast cancer deaths as a proportion of all deaths during 1968-2019 among all women and by five race/ethnicity groups with sufficient numbers for estimation: Hispanic (all races), American Indian/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islanders (regardless of ethnicity), non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic White. Results: Initially increasing after 1968, age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates have decreased among all racial/ethnic groups since 1988. The age-adjusted percent of all deaths due to breast cancer also has been declining for non-Hispanic White women since about 1990 while increasing or holding steady for other race/ethnic groups. In 2019, the age-adjusted percent of deaths due to breast cancer for women was highest for Asian/Pacific Islanders (5.6%) followed by non-Hispanic Black (4.5%), Hispanic (4.4%), non-Hispanic White (4.1%), and American Indian/Alaska Native women (2.6%).

Objective: To compare tradeoffs of screening strategies in Black women versus White women under current guidelines. Design: An established model from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network simulated screening outcomes using race-specific inputs for subtype distribution; breast density; mammography performance; age-, stage-, and subtype-specific treatment effects; and non–breast cancer mortality. Setting: United States. Participants: A 1980 U.S. birth cohort of Black and White women. Intervention: Screening strategies until age 74 years with varying initiation ages and intervals. Measurements: Outcomes included benefits (life-years gained [LYG], breast cancer deaths averted, and mortality reduction), harms (mammographies, false positives, and overdiagnoses), and benefit–harm ratios (tradeoffs) by race. Efficiency (benefits per unit resource), mortality disparity reduction, and equity in tradeoffs were evaluated. Equitable strategies for Black women were defined as those with tradeoffs closest to benchmark values for screening White women biennially from ages 50 to 74 years. Results: Biennial screening from ages 45 to 74 years was most efficient for Black women, whereas biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 years was most equitable. Initiating screening 10 years earlier in Black versus White women reduced Black–White mortality disparities by 57% with similar LYG per mammogram for both populations. Selection of the most equitable strategy was sensitive to assumptions about disparities in real-world treatment effectiveness: The less effective treatment was for Black women, the more intensively Black women could be screened before tradeoffs fell short of those experienced by White women. Limitation: Single model. Conclusion: Initiating biennial screening in Black women at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality disparities and yields benefit–harm ratios that are similar to tradeoffs of White women screened biennially from ages 50 to 74 years.","tags":null,"title":"Identifying Equitable Screening Mammography Strategies for Black Women in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Temte","Shari Barlow","Maureen Goss","Emily Temte","Cristalyne Bell","Cecilia He","Caroline Hamer","Amber Schemmel","Brad Maerz","Lily Comp","Mitchell Arnold","Kimberly Breunig","Sarah Clifford","Erik Reisdorf","Peter Shult","Mary Wedig","Thomas Haupt","Jim Conway","Ronald Gangnon","Ashley Fowlkes","Amra Uzicanin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632700800,"objectID":"86b874278e4066373caefb53f1388cb5","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/temte-2021/","publishdate":"2021-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/temte-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Influenza viruses pose significant disease burdens through annual seasonal outbreaks and unpredictable pandemics. Existing influenza surveillance programs have relied heavily on medical facility reporting influenza. Continuously monitoring cause-specific school absenteeism may identify local activity acceleration of seasonal influenza. The Oregon Child Absenteeism Due to Respiratory Disease Study (ORCHARDS) implements daily school-based monitoring of influenza-like illness-specific student absenteeism (a-ILI) in pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools and assesses this approach for early detection of accelerated influenza and other respiratory pathogen transmission in schools and surrounding communities. Methods: Starting in September 2014, ORCHARDS has combined reporting of daily absenteeism though automated processes within six schools and home visits to school children with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Demographic, epidemiological and symptom data are collected along with respiratory specimens. Specimens are tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Household members may participate in a supplementary household transmission study. Community comparisons are made possible using a pre-existing, long-standing, and highly effective influenza surveillance program, based on medically attended influenza at five primary care clinics in the same geographical area. Results: Over the first five years, a-ILI accounted for 6,634 (0.20%) of 3,260,461 student school days. Viral pathogens were detected in 64.5% of 1,728 children visited at home with ARI.

Resistance (strength) training can deliver these benefits; yet few women participate in resistance exercise. The purpose of this study was to describe both physiological and functional changes following a home-based strength training intervention. Methods Forty post-treatment endometrial cancer survivors within 5 years of diagnosis were enrolled in a pilot randomized trial, comparing twice-weekly home-based strength exercise to wait list control. Participants conducted the exercises twice per week for 10 supervised weeks with 5 weeks of follow-up. Measures included DXA-measured lean mass, functional fitness assessments, blood biomarkers, and quality of life outcomes. Results On average, participants were 60.9 years old (SD = 8.7) with BMI of 39.9 kg/m2 (SD = 15.2). At baseline, participants had 51.2% (SD = 6.0) body fat, which was not different between groups. Improvements were seen in the 30-s chair sit to stand (d = .99), the 30-s arm curl (d = .91), and the 8-ft up-and-go test (d = .63). No changes were measured for HbA1c or C-reactive protein. No changes were observed for flexibility (chair sit and reach, back scratch tests), 6-min walk test, maximum handgrip test, anxiety, depression, fatigue, or self-efficacy for exercise. Conclusions Home-based muscle-strengthening exercise led to favorable and clinically relevant improvements in 3 of 7 physical function assessments. Physical function, body composition, blood biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes were feasible to measure. These fitness improvements were observed over a relatively short time frame of 10 weeks.","tags":null,"title":"Improvements in strength and agility measures of functional fitness following a telehealth‑delivered home‑based exercise intervention in endometrial cancer survivors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Howard Tang","Anna Lang","Shu Mei Teo","Louise Judd","Ronald Gangnon","Mike Evans","Kris Lee","Rose Vrtis","Patrick Holt","Rob Lemanske","Dan Jackson","Kathryn Holt","Jim Gern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619827200,"objectID":"dd20cdeb1e8af0e899afd3eefe73e3fd","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/tang-2021/","publishdate":"2020-10-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tang-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: Studies indicate that the nasal microbiome may correlate strongly with the presence or future risk of childhood asthma.\nObjectives: In this study, we tested whether developmental trajectories of the nasopharyngeal microbiome in early life and the composition of the microbiome during illnesses were related to risk of childhood asthma.\nMethods: Children participating in the Childhood Origins of Asthma study (n=285) provided nasopharyngeal mucus samples in the first two years of life, during routine healthy study visits (2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age) and episodes of respiratory illnesses, which were analyzed for respiratory viruses and bacteria.

Methods: We used Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study data (age 3 N=3288 and 49% Black, 26% Hispanic, 22% non-Hispanic White; age 5 N=3001 and 51% Black, 25% Hispanic, 21% non-Hispanic White; age 9 N=3630 and 50% Black, 25% Hispanic, 21% non-Hispanic White) and ordinal logistic regression to model problem behavior at ages 3, 5, and 9 on maternal depression status at age 3. Results: At age 9, children whose mother was depressed when the child was age 3 were significantly more likely to have higher internalizing (AOR=1.92, 95% CI: 1.42,2.61) and externalizing (AOR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.10,2.48) problem behavior scores. Race/ethnicity did not have moderating effects, potentially due to a limitation of the data that required use of maternal self-reported race/ethnicity as a proxy for child race/ethnicity. Conclusions for Practice: Exposure to maternal depression after the prenatal and perinatal periods may have a negative association with children’s behavioral development through age 9. Interventions that directly target maternal depression during this time should be developed.

Racist prejudice depicts male individuals of color as more prone to criminality than White males. We described long-term patterns of weapon-carrying in US schools among Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black/African American, and Hispanic boys, hypothesizing that in contrast to racist stereotypes, boys of color did not bring weapons into schools more often than Non-Hispanic White boys in recent years. Methods: We conducted a time series analysis using 1993-2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data comparing boys’ self-reported weapon-carrying in a nationally representative sample of US high schools by race/ethnicity and age, and by self-reported experience of safety and violence at school. Results: Weapon-carrying in schools has declined among all boys. Comparing all schools, we found no significant differences in weapon-carrying (4-5%) by race/ethnicity in 2017/2019. Boys who reported experiencing violence or feeling unsafe at school were at least twice as likely to bring a weapon into school, and such negative experiences were more common among boys of color (8-12%) than Non-Hispanic White boys (4-5%). In schools perceived as safer, NonHispanic White boys have been more likely to bring weapons into schools than Non-Hispanic Black/African American or Hispanic boys in the past 20 years. Conclusion: Our findings contradict racist prejudice with regards to weapon-carrying in schools, particularly in more favorable school environments.

Results will also shed light on the potential moderating roles of hospital academic affiliation and Catholic status on the association between unbundling and IPP LARC provision. Methods: We used a pre-post design to examine the association between unbundling and IPP LARC provision. We observed Medicaid-covered childbirth deliveries in Wisconsin hospitals between January 2016-December 2017 (n=45,200) in the State Inpatient Database from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We conducted multivariate regressions using generalized linear mixed models. Results: From 2016 to 2017, IPP LARC provision increased from 0.28% to 0.44% of deliveries (p=.003). In our adjusted model, IPP LARC provision was 1.55 times more likely in the post-period vs. the pre-period (95% CI: 1.12-2.13). Both before and after unbundling, IPP LARC provision was significantly more common in academic vs nonacademic settings and was exceedingly rare in Catholic institutions. Conclusions: In contrast to many early-adopting states, in this later-adopting state, Wisconsin Medicaid’s unbundling of LARC from the global fee did not meaningfully change rates of IPP LARC provision in the state. Results indicate that delivery hospital characteristics are strong correlates of access to IPP LARC and suggest the need for interventions—perhaps outside of the inpatient setting—to ensure that patients can access desired contraceptive methods promptly postpartum.","tags":null,"title":"Provision of Immediate Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives Before and After Wisconsin Medicaid’s Payment Change.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junho Lee","Maria Kamenetsky","Ronald Gangnon","Jun Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1611964800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611964800,"objectID":"5faa13f5e9ecb225628889c937f9a0ca","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/lee-2021/","publishdate":"2021-01-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In regression analysis for spatio-temporal data, identifying clusters of spatial units over time in a regression coefficient could provide insight into the unique relationship between a response and covariates in certain subdomains of space and time windows relative to the background in other parts of the spatial domain and the time period of interest.

Methods: Total retinal thickness within the macular area, and individual layer thickness was determined for CAREDS2 participants (n=906 eyes, 473 women) from the Women’s Health Initiative using Heidelberg spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Mean measurements within the OCT grid were compared across age tertiles (69-78, 78-83, 83-101 years) and AMD outcomes (no AMD, early, intermediate , late AMD). Results: Total retinal thickness in the central circle, inner ring, and outer ring were mean ± standard deviation 277 ± 34 μm, 326 ± 20 μm, and 282 ± 15 μm, respectively. Thickness did not vary by age in the central circle, but decreased with age in the inner and outer circles (p≤0.004). Specifically, ganglion cell (GCL), inner plexiform (IPL), and outer nuclear (ONL) layer thickness decreased with age in the inner and outer rings (p≤0.003). Age-adjusted retinal thickness in all three circles did not vary by AMD outcomes, except that the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer thickness was greatest in eyes with late AMD (p≤0.001).

Accurate assessment of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) is important for measuring adherence to physical activity guidelines in the United States and abroad. Therefore, this systematic review synthesizes the state of the validation literature regarding wearable trackers and MVPA. Methods: A systematic search of the PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted through October 2019 (PROSPERO Q1 registration number: CRD42018103808). Studies were eligible if they reported on the validity of MVPA and used devices from Fitbit, Apple, or Garmin released in 2012 or later or available on the market at the time of review. A meta-analysis was conducted on the correlation measures comparing wearables with the ActiGraph. Results: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; all used a Fitbit device; one included a Garmin model and no Apple-device studies were found. Moderate to high correlations (.7–.9) were found between MVPA from the wearable tracker versus criterion measure (ActiGraph n = 14). Considerable heterogeneity was seen with respect to the specific definition of MVPA for the criterion device, the statistical techniques used to assess validity, and the correlations between wearable trackers and ActiGraph across studies. Conclusions: There is a need for standardization of validation methods and reporting outcomes in individual studies to allow for comparability across the evidence base. Despite the different methods utilized within studies, nearly all concluded that wearable trackers are valid for measuring MVPA.","tags":null,"title":"Accuracy of Wearable Trackers for Measuring Moderate- to Vigorous-Intensity Physical Activity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somya Rastogi","Amye Tevaarwerk","Mary Sesto","Brittany Van Remortel","Preshita Date","Ronald Gangnon","Keith Thraen-Borowski","Lisa Cadmus-Bertram"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595894400,"objectID":"6b5d78bcbe419c0b20247c56fa182dcb","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/rastogi-2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rastogi-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives This pilot trial tested the effect of adding a multi‐level, technology‐based physical activity intervention module to a standard survivorship care plan for breast and colorectal cancer survivors.

Relative to comparison, the intervention was associated with moderate‐to‐large improvements in physical health (effect size: d = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.0, 0.78), mental health (d = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.19, 0.99), sleep impairment (d = 0.62, 95% CI = −1.02, −0.22), and exercise self‐efficacy (d = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.20, 1.0).\nConclusions The intervention delivered meaningful improvements in survivors' quality of life, social support, and sleep impairment. If replicated in a larger sample, adding a technology‐supported physical activity module to survivorship care plans may be a practical strategy for supporting healthy survivorship.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of a Technology-Supported Physical Activity Intervention on Health-Related Quality of Life and Sleep in Cancer Survivors: A Randomized, Controlled Trial","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheryl Steiman","Mike Evans","Kris Lee","Mike Lasarev","Ronald Gangnon","Brent Olson","Kate Barnes","Casper Bendixsen","Chris Seroogy","Jim Gern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1594598400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594598400,"objectID":"1458533ce74845f5b2119b7e2a08851e","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/steiman-2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/steiman-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Background Farm exposures may reduce the risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children, but this is controversial and US data are limited. Objective This study was conducted to identify patterns of farm exposure in Wisconsin family farms that modify AD incidence and prevalence in early childhood. Methods Environmental exposures, health history and clinical outcomes were prospectively recorded for 111 farm families and 129 non-farm families enrolled in the Wisconsin Infant Study Cohort birth cohort study. Exposures from the prenatal and early postnatal (2-month) visits were evaluated together with parental report of AD diagnosis by a healthcare provider through age 24 months. Latent class analysis was performed with prenatal and early postnatal farm-exposure variables to assign farm children to three classes. Results Overall, children of farm families had reduced AD incidence (P=0.03). Within farm families, exposures including poultry (3% vs 28%, P=0.003), pig (4% vs 25%, P=0.04), feed grain (13% vs 34%, P=0.02) and number of animal species were inversely associated with AD incidence. Among the latent class groups, children in families with diverse or more intense farm exposures (Classes A and B) had reduced AD incidence, while low-exposure (Class C) infants had AD incidence similar to non-farm children. Conclusions Infants in Wisconsin farm families had reduced AD incidence, and patterns of farm exposures further defined AD risk. These findings suggest that exposure to diverse farm animals, feed and bedding during the prenatal period and in early infancy reduce the risk of early-onset AD, a phenotype associated with multiple other atopic diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Patterns of Farm Exposure are Associated with Reduced Incidence of Atopic Dermatitis in Early Life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carole Ober","Chris McKennan","Kevin Magnaye","Matthew Altman","Charles Washington","Catherine Stanhope","Katherine Naughton","Mario Rosasco","Leonard Bacharier","Dean Billheimer","Diane Gold","Lisa Gress","Tina Hartert","Suzanne Havstad","Gurjit Khurana Hershey","Brian Hallmark","Kyle Hogarth","Dan Jackson","Christine Johnson","Meyer Kattan","Rob Lemanske","Sue Lynch","Eneida Mendonca","Rachel Miller","Edward Naureckas","George O'Connor","Chris Seroogy","Ganesa Wegienka","Steven White","Robert Wood","Anne Wright","Ed Zoratti","Fernando Martinez","Dennis Ownby","Dan Nicolae","Albert Levin","Jim Gern","Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes-Children's Respiratory Research Workgroup"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593993600,"objectID":"0a76a3dcf41dae1855a98e9aec1dca77","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/ober-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ober-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: African ancestry is associated with a higher prevalence and greater severity of asthma than European ancestries, yet genetic studies of the most common locus associated with childhood-onset asthma, 17q12-21, in African Americans have been inconclusive. The aim of this study was to leverage both the phenotyping of the Children's Respiratory and Environmental Workgroup (CREW) birth cohort consortium, and the reduced linkage disequilibrium in African Americans, to fine map the 17q12-21 locus. Methods: We first did a genetic association study and meta-analysis using 17q12-21 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for childhood-onset asthma in 1613 European American and 870 African American children from the CREW consortium. Nine tag SNPs were selected based on linkage disequilibrium patterns at 17q12-21 and their association with asthma, considering the effect allele under an additive model (0, 1, or 2 effect alleles). Results were meta-analysed with publicly available summary data from the EVE consortium (on 4303 European American and 3034 African American individuals) for seven of the nine SNPs of interest. Subsequently, we tested for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) among the SNPs associated with childhood-onset asthma and the expression of 17q12-21 genes in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 85 African American CREW children and in upper airway epithelial cells from 246 African American CREW children; and in lower airway epithelial cells from 44 European American and 72 African American adults from a case-control study of asthma genetic risk in Chicago (IL, USA).

Although food insecurity and housing instability are associated with adult depression and child behavior, how these economic factors mediate or moderate the relationship between maternal depression and child problem behavior is not understood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether food insecurity and housing instability are mediators and/or moderators of the relationship between maternal depression when a child is age 3 and children's problem behaviors at age 9 and to determine whether these mechanisms differ by race/ethnicity. We used the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Food insecurity and housing instability at age 5 were tested as potential mediators and moderators of the relationship between maternal depression status at age 3 and child problem behavior at age 9. A path analysis confirmed our hypothesis that food insecurity and housing instability partially mediate the relationship between maternal depression when the child is age 3 and children’s problem behavior at age 9. However, housing instability was only a mediator for externalizing problem behavior and not internalizing problem behavior or overall problem behavior. Results of the moderation analysis suggest that neither food insecurity nor housing instability were moderators. None of the mechanisms explored differed by race/ethnicity. While our findings stress the continued need for interventions that address child food insecurity, they emphasize the importance of interventions that address maternal mental health throughout a child's life. Given the central role of maternal health in child development, additional efforts should be made to target maternal depression, during and following the perinatal period.","tags":null,"title":"Food Insecurity and Housing Instability Partially Mediate the Association Between Maternal Depression and Child Problem Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jane Mahoney","Ronald Gangnon","Lindy Clemson","LaVerne Jaros","Sandy Cech","Jill Renken"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580774400,"objectID":"a830dae0a36158f0461e9397126b40af","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/mahoney-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.789007Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mahoney-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction.  Translating complex behavior change interventions into practice can be accompanied by a loss of fidelity and effectiveness.  We present the evaluation of two sequential phases of implementation of a complex evidence-based community workshop to reduce falls, using the Replicating Effective Programs Framework.. Between the two phases, the workshop training and delivery were revised to improve fidelity with key elements. . Methods. Stepping On program participants completed a questionnaire at baseline (Phase 1: n=361, Phase 2: n=2219) and 6 months post workshop (Phase 1: n=232, Phase 2: n=1281). Phase 2 participants had an additional follow up at 12 months (n=883). Outcomes were the number of falls in the prior 6 months and the falls behavioral risk (FaB) score. Results. Workshop participation in Phase 1 was associated with a 6% reduction in falls (RR=0.94, 95% CI 0.74, 1.20) and a 0.14 improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.11- 0.18) at 6 months. Workshop participation in Phase 2 was associated with a 38% reduction in falls (RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.68), and a 0.16 improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.14-0.18) at 6 months, and a 28% reduction in falls (RR=0.72, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.80) and a 0.19 score improvement in FaB score (95% CI, 0.17-0.21) at 12 months follow-up. Conclusions:  Effectiveness can be maintained with widespread dissemination of a complex behavior change intervention if attention is paid to fidelity of key elements.

Bicycling is associated with both health and environmental benefits, but also poses a risk of injury. The use of bicycle helmets has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cycling. It is unknown if helmet use differs across Wisconsin geographic areas and socio-demographic groups.\nMethods: Data were obtained from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW).  Bicycle use and helmet use frequency were determined from a self-administered questionnaire that contained questions specific to preventative health behaviors.  Descriptive statistics summarized overall bicycle ridership. Chi-Square and Student’s t-tests were performed to assess relationships between bicycle and helmet use across geographic categories and socio-demographic groups.\nResults: Differences between sex, race or ethnicity, and education level were found to be associated with bicycle ridership and the frequency of helmet use.  Men were significantly more likely to report riding a bicycle and never wearing a helmet.  Individuals from urban communities reported always wearing a helmet more often than rural communities.  Higher education levels were associated with higher levels of bicycle and helmet use.  Race or ethnicity was not associated with bicycle ridership, but was associated with differences in helmet use frequency.\nConclusion: Nearly half of those who ride bicycles in Wisconsin report never wearing a helmet.  Since bicycle ridership and helmet use were found to be associated with a number of socio-demographic characteristics, any solution should consider the role of equity when attempting to increase ridership or helmet use.","tags":null,"title":"Bicycling Rates and the Prevalence of Bicycle Helmet Usage in the State of Wisconsin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryan Westergaard","Karli Hochstatter","Paige Andrews","Danielle Kahn","Casey Schumann","Alec Winzenried","Ajay Sethi","Ronald Gangnon","Jim Sosman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"82a32f1f58713cae9d8d111d47f2fe09","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/westergaard-2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/westergaard-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Antiretroviral therapy is successfully administered to people living with HIV while they are incarcerated in most US prison systems, but interruptions in treatment are common after people are released.

While computationally convenient, squared error loss on the rank scale may not represent the true inferential goals of rank consumers. We construct alternative loss functions based on three components: (1) the inferential goal (rank position or pairwise comparisons), (2) the scale (original, log-transformed or rank) and (3) the (positional or pairwise) loss function (0/1, squared error or absolute error). We can obtain optimal ranks for loss functions based on rank positions and nearly optimal ranks for loss functions based on pairwise comparisons paired with highest posterior density (HPD) credible intervals.

As a step towards bridging this gap, this trial tested the feasibility of augmenting care planning with a multi-level physical activity intervention. METHODS:\nBreast and colorectal cancer survivors were enrolled alongside a self-selected support partner (e.g., spouse, friend). Survivors received a care plan alone (comparison group) versus one augmented with a 12-week physical activity module (intervention group). For the intervention group dyads, both members received a multi-component program including Fitbit trackers, with the survivor's Fitbit linked to his/her electronic health record (EHR). Treating clinicians received periodic updates regarding the survivors' physical activity. The primary outcome was ActiGraph-measured physical activity, analyzed using mixed models. Feedback questionnaires were administered to participants and clinicians at 12 weeks. RESULTS:\nSurvivors (n=50) were 54.4±11.2 years of age and 2.0±1.5 years post-diagnosis. Survivors in the intervention group increased moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) by 69±84 min/week vs. a 20±71 min/week decrease in the comparison group (p=.001). Likewise, daily steps increased by 1470±1881 vs. a 398±1751 decrease (P=.002). Among responding clinicians, 100% looked at survivors' activity data within the EHR at least once and 80% said it provided insight into their patients' lifestyles.

Growing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that distinct time periods of heightened susceptibility to endocrine disruptors exist throughout the life course. The influence of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk may be greater during several windows of susceptibility (WOS) in a woman's life, including prenatal development, puberty, pregnancy, and the menopausal transition. These time windows are considered as specific periods of susceptibility for breast cancer because significant structural and functional changes occur in the mammary gland, as well as alterations in the mammary micro-environment and hormone signaling that may influence risk. Breast cancer research focused on these breast cancer WOS will accelerate understanding of disease etiology and prevention. MAIN TEXT:\nDespite the plausible heightened mechanistic influences of environmental chemicals on breast cancer risk during time periods of change in the mammary gland's structure and function, most human studies of environmental chemicals are not focused on specific WOS. This article reviews studies conducted over the past few decades that have specifically addressed the effect of environmental chemicals and metals on breast cancer risk during at least one of these WOS. In addition to summarizing the broader evidence-base specific to WOS, we include discussion of the NIH-funded Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program (BCERP) which included population-based and basic science research focused on specific WOS to evaluate associations between breast cancer risk and particular classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals-including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, perfluorinated compounds, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phenols-and metals. We outline ways in which ongoing transdisciplinary BCERP projects incorporate animal research and human epidemiologic studies in close partnership with community organizations and communication scientists to identify research priorities and effectively translate evidence-based findings to the public and policy makers. CONCLUSIONS:\nAn integrative model of breast cancer research is needed to determine the impact and mechanisms of action of endocrine disruptors at different WOS. By focusing on environmental chemical exposure during specific WOS, scientists and their community partners may identify when prevention efforts are likely to be most effective.","tags":null,"title":"Environmental exposures during windows of susceptibility for breast cancer: a framework for prevention research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Producing rhinovirus (RV) inocula from nasal secretions has required prolonged observation of the virus donor to exclude extraneous pathogens. We produced a RV-A16 inoculum using reverse genetics and determined the dose necessary to cause moderate colds in seronegative volunteers. METHODS:\nThe consensus sequence of RV-A16 from a previous inoculum was cloned, and inoculum virus was produced using reverse genetics techniques. After safety testing, volunteers were inoculated with either RV-A16 (n = 26) or placebo (n = 10), Jackson cold scores were recorded, and nasal secretions were tested for shedding of RV-A16 ribonucleic acid. RESULTS:\nThe reverse genetics process produced infectious virus that was neutralized by specific antisera and had a mutation rate similar to conventional virus growth techniques. The 1000 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) dose produced moderate colds in most individuals with effects similar to that of a previously tested conventional RV-A16 inoculum. CONCLUSIONS:\nReverse genetics techniques produced a RV-A16 inoculum that can cause clinical colds in seronegative volunteers, and they also serve as a stable source of virus for laboratory use. The recombinant production procedures eliminate the need to derive seed virus from nasal secretions, thus precluding introduction of extraneous pathogens through this route.","tags":null,"title":"Development of a Rhinovirus Inoculum Using a Reverse Genetics Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diana Dorn","Jessica Gorzelitz","Ronald Gangnon","David Bell","Kelli Koltyn","Lisa Cadmus-Bertram"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"dde9ea6ca792938153769241ab59e19d","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/dorn-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.675971Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dorn-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nActivity trackers are now ubiquitous in certain populations, with potential applications for health promotion and monitoring and chronic disease management. Understanding the accuracy of this technology is critical to the appropriate and productive use of wearables in health research. Although other peer-reviewed validations have examined other features (eg, steps and heart rate), no published studies to date have addressed the accuracy of automatic activity type detection and duration accuracy in wearable trackers. OBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of this study was to examine the ability of 4 commercially available wearable activity trackers (Fitbits Flex 2, Fitbit Alta HR, Fitbit Charge 2, and Garmin Vívosmart HR), in a controlled setting, to correctly and automatically identify the type and duration of the physical activity being performed. METHODS:\nA total of 8 activity types, including walking and running (on both a treadmill and outdoors), a run embedded in walking bouts, elliptical use, outdoor biking, and pool lap swimming, were tested by 28 to 34 healthy adult participants (69 total participants who participated in some to all activity types). Actual activity type and duration were recorded by study personnel and compared with tracker data using descriptive statistics and mean absolute percent error (MAPE). RESULTS:\nThe proportion of trials in which the activity type was correctly identified was 93% to 97% (depending on the tracker) for treadmill walking, 93% to 100% for treadmill running, 36% to 62% for treadmill running when preceded and followed by a walk, 97% to 100% for outdoor walking, 100% for outdoor running, 3% to 97% for using an elliptical, 44% to 97% for biking, and 87.5% for swimming. When activities were correctly identified, the MAPE of the detected duration versus the actual activity duration was between 7% and 7.9% for treadmill walking, 8.7% and 144.8% for treadmill running, 23.6% and 28.9% for treadmill running when preceded and followed by a walk, 4.9% and 11.8% for outdoor walking, 5.6% and 9.6% for outdoor running, 9.7% and 13% for using an elliptical, 9.5% and 17.7% for biking, and was 26.9% for swimming. CONCLUSIONS:\nIn a controlled setting, wearable activity trackers provide accurate recognition of the type of some common physical activities, especially outdoor walking and running and walking on a treadmill. The accuracy of measurement of activity duration varied considerably by activity type and tracker model and was poor for complex sets of activity, such as a run embedded within 2 walking segments.","tags":null,"title":"Automatic Identification of Physical Activity Type and Duration by Wearable Activity Trackers: A Validation Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Klein","Kris Lee","Michael Tsai","Karen Cruickshanks","Ronald Gangnon","Barbara Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"959b9ff1c41ce1a2904cb1ddbbc7f6c1","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/klein-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.679268Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo examine the relationship between serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) cholesterol and the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) over a 25-year period in a sample of persons from the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES). DESIGN:\nObservational prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS:\nA total of 4972 people from the BDES (aged 43-84 years and living in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin in 1988) seen during at least 1 of 6 examination phases at approximately 5-year intervals between 1988 and 2016. METHODS:\nA 50% random sample of participants (N = 2468) was selected for ox-LDL measurements. Stored frozen specimens from every examination phase were processed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from a single batch. All available intervals were included for a person, resulting in 6586 person-visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nAge-related macular degeneration was assessed using the Wisconsin Age-related Maculopathy Grading System, and severity was defined using a 5-step severity scale. The severity of the worse eye at each examination was used for analyses. A multi-state Markov (MSM) model was fit to simultaneously assess the ox-LDL relationship to all AMD transitions, including incidence of any AMD, incidence of late AMD, and worsening and improvement of AMD over the 25 years of the study. RESULTS:\nThe mean (standard deviation) level of ox-LDL was 75.3 (23.1) U/L at the baseline examination. When adjusting for age, sex, ARMS2 and CFH risk alleles, and examination phase, the ox-LDL at the beginning of a period was not statistically significantly associated with the incidence of any AMD (hazard ratio per 10 U/L ox-LDL was 1.03, 95% confidence interval 0.98,1.09). Furthermore, ox-LDL was not associated with worsening anywhere along the AMD severity scale, nor with incidence of late AMD. The lack of relationships of ox-LDL to the incidence of any AMD or worsening of AMD remained after adjustment for history of statin use, smoking status, body mass index, and history of cardiovascular disease (data not shown). CONCLUSIONS:\nOur findings do not provide evidence for statistically significant relationships between ox-LDL and AMD disease development or worsening of AMD.","tags":null,"title":"Oxidized Low-density Lipoprotein and the Incidence of Age-related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rachel Sippy","Diego Herrera","David Gaus","Ronald Gangnon","Jonathan Patz","Jorge Osorio"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"96f94aa805b54fd95d82890dcf221efb","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/sippy-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.677113Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sippy-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Season is a major determinant of infectious disease rates, including arboviruses spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Seasonal patterns of disease are driven by a combination of climatic or environmental factors, such as temperature or rainfall, and human behavioral time trends, such as school year schedules, holidays, and weekday-weekend patterns. These factors affect both disease rates and healthcare-seeking behavior. Seasonality of dengue fever has been studied in the context of climatic factors, but short- and long-term time trends are less well-understood. With 2009-2016 medical record data from patients diagnosed with dengue fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador, we used Poisson generalized linear modeling to determine short- and long-term seasonal patterns of dengue fever, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. In a subset analysis, we determined the impact of school schedules on school-aged children. With a separate model, we examined the effect of climate on diagnosis patterns. In the first model, the most important predictors of dengue fever were annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends (as represented by a spline for the full study duration), day of the week, and hospital. Seasonal trends showed single peaks in case diagnoses, during mid-March. Compared to the average of all days, cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays (risk ratio (RR): 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.51) and Thursdays (RR: 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.53), and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.65-1.01) and Sundays (RR: 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.95). Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas (RR: 2.77, 95% CI 1.46-5.24). School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. In the climate model, important climate variables included the monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days. This is the first report of long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador, one of few reports from rural patients, and one of very few studies utilizing daily disease reports. These results can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, as well as global and regional models of dengue fever trends.","tags":null,"title":"Seasonal patterns of dengue fever in rural Ecuador: 2009-2016","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jackson Musuuza","Pramod Guru","John O’Horo","Connie Bongiorno","Marc Korobkin","Ronald Gangnon","Nasia Safdar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"ad08c348cff785f1b8873431d06d4f5e","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/musuuza-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.676499Z","relpermalink":"/publication/musuuza-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nChlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) bathing of hospitalized patients may have benefit in reducing hospital-acquired bloodstream infections (HABSIs). However, the magnitude of effect, implementation fidelity, and patient-centered outcomes are unclear. In this meta-analysis, we examined the effect of CHG bathing on prevention of HABSIs and assessed fidelity to implementation of this behavioral intervention. METHODS:\nWe undertook a meta-analysis by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane's CENTRAL registry from database inception through January 4, 2019 without language restrictions. We included randomized controlled trials, cluster randomized trials and quasi-experimental studies that evaluated the effect of CHG bathing versus a non-CHG comparator for prevention of HABSIs in any adult healthcare setting. Studies of pediatric patients, of pre-surgical CHG use, or without a non-CHG comparison arm were excluded. Outcomes of this study were HABSIs, patient-centered outcomes, such as patient comfort during the bath, and implementation fidelity assessed through five elements: adherence, exposure or dose, quality of the delivery, participant responsiveness, and program differentiation. Three authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality; a random-effects model was used. RESULTS:\nWe included 26 studies with 861,546 patient-days and 5259 HABSIs. CHG bathing markedly reduced the risk of HABSIs (IRR = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-0.68). The effect of CHG bathing was consistent within subgroups: randomized (0.67, 95% CI: 0.53-0.85) vs. non-randomized studies (0.54, 95% CI: 0.44-0.65), bundled (0.66, 95% CI: 0.62-0.70) vs. non-bundled interventions (0.51, 95% CI: 0.39-0.68), CHG impregnated wipes (0.63, 95% CI: 0.55-0.73) vs. CHG solution (0.41, 95% CI: 0.26-0.64), and intensive care unit (ICU) (0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.68) vs. non-ICU settings (0.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.83). Only three studies reported all five measures of fidelity, and ten studies did not report any patient-centered outcomes. CONCLUSIONS:\nPatient bathing with CHG significantly reduced the incidence of HABSIs in both ICU and non-ICU settings. Many studies did not report fidelity to the intervention or patient-centered outcomes. For sustainability and replicability essential for effective implementation, fidelity assessment that goes beyond whether a patient received an intervention or not should be standard practice particularly for complex behavioral interventions such as CHG bathing.","tags":null,"title":"The impact of chlorhexidine bathing on hospital-acquired bloodstream infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!

Considerable research documents that longer tai chi courses can reduce falls and improve balance. However, longer courses can be challenging to implement. Our goal was to evaluate whether a short 6-week modified tai chi course could be effective at reducing falls risk if older adults designed a personal home practice plan to receive a greater tai chi 'dose' during the 6 weeks. DESIGN:\nA 3-city wait-listed randomized trial was conducted. Habituation Intention and Social Cognitive Theories framed the 'coaching' strategy by which participants designed practice plans. RE-AIM and Treatment Fidelity Frameworks were used to evaluate implementation and dissemination issues. Three advisory groups advised the study on intervention planning, implementation, and evaluation. To measure effectiveness, we used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended measures for falls risk including leg strength, balance, and mobility and gait. In addition, we measured balance confidence and executive function. RESULTS:\nProgram Implementation resulted in large class sizes, strong participant retention, high program fidelity and effectiveness. Participants reported practicing an average of 6 days a week and more than 25 min/day.

To better understand the degree of impact, we analysed electronic health records and compared risks of respiratory infections within communities while schools were in session and out-of-session. A time series analysis of weekly respiratory infection diagnoses from 28 family medicine clinics in Wisconsin showed that people under the age of 65 experienced an increased risk of ARI when schools were in session. For children aged 5-17 years, the risk ratio for the first week of a school session was 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.34), the second week of a session was 1.39 (95% CI 1.15-1.68) and more than 2 weeks into a session was 1.43 (95% CI 1.20-1.71). Less significant increased risk ratios were also observed in young children (0-4 years) and adults (18-64 years). These results were obtained after modelling for baseline seasonal variations in disease prevalence and controlling for short-term changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity.

We investigated the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and all-cause or breast cancer-specific mortality after a diagnosis of locoregional breast cancer. METHODS:\nWomen diagnosed in 2004 with AJCC Stage I, II, or III breast cancer (n = 5394) were identified from a population-based National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) patterns of care study (POC-BP) drawing from registries in seven U.S. states. Differences in overall and breast cancer-specific mortality were investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, including age- and stage-based subgroup analyses. RESULTS:\nIn women 70 or older, higher BMI was associated with lower overall mortality (HR for a 5 kg/m2 difference in BMI = 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.95). There was no significant association between BMI and overall mortality for women under 70. BMI was not associated with breast cancer death in the full sample, but among women with Stage I disease; those in the highest BMI category had significantly higher breast cancer mortality (HR for BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 vs. 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 = 4.74, 95% CI 1.78-12.59). CONCLUSIONS:\nContrary to our hypothesis, greater BMI was not associated with higher overall mortality. Among older women, BMI was inversely related to overall mortality, with a null association among younger women. Higher BMI was associated with breast cancer mortality among women with Stage I disease, but not among women with more advanced disease.","tags":null,"title":"Obesity and mortality after locoregional breast cancer diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Klein","Kris Lee","Lorraine Danforth","Michael Tsai","Ronald Gangnon","Stacy Meuer","Tien Wong","Carol Cheung","Barbara Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"3c2f64057052417793c4711a1283e6b6","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/klein-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.681947Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo examine the relationships of retinal vessel geometric characteristics (RVGCs) to the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DESIGN:\nObservational, prospective cohort study.

A total of 3846 person-interval data from these follow-up examinations are the basis for the analyses. METHODS:\nDiabetic retinopathy and macular edema were assessed by grading of 30° stereoscopic color fundus photographs. Retinal vessel geometric characteristics were assessed using the Singapore I Vessel Assessment program from a digitized copy of 1 of the field 1 fundus photographs obtained at baseline and follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nThe 5-year incidence of any DR, progression of DR, and incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and clinically significant macular edema (CSME) in right eyes. RESULTS:\nIncident DR occurred in 45%, progression in 32%, PDR in 10%, and CSME in 5%. While adjusting for glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, and other factors, retinal arteriolar simple tortuosity was associated significantly with the incidence of any DR (odds ratio [OR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.35). Retinal venular branching angle was associated significantly with progression of DR (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36), retinal venular curvature tortuosity was associated significantly with the incidence of PDR (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.30), and retinal venular branching angle (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.10-1.82) was associated significantly with the incidence of CSME. There were no significant associations of other RVGCs with any of the DR outcomes in the full multivariate model. Inclusion of all possible RVGCs did not improve the predictive value of the models that already included retinal vessel diameter and baseline DR severity level.

Health behaviors and QoL were self-reported during biennial post-diagnosis interviews. Physical and mental QoL were measured using the validated SF-36 questionnaire. Generalized linear regression was used to determine the association between behaviors and QoL with adjustment for confounders. Lagged behavior variables were used to predict QoL during follow-up and avoid reverse causation. RESULTS:\nWomen reported 3,536 QoL observations over an average 7.9 years of follow-up. Women maintaining a healthy BMI had on average a significantly higher summary measure score of physical QoL than obese women (normal versus obese: β = 3.02; 2.18, 3.85). Physical QoL scores were also elevated among those who were physically active (5 + h/week vs. none: β = 1.96; 0.72, 3.20), those consuming at least seven drinks/week of alcohol (vs. none; β = 1.40; 0.39, 2.41), and nonsmokers (vs. current smokers: β = 1.80; 0.89, 2.71).

Employment of common inputs permits greater ability to compare model output than when each model begins with different input parameters. The use of common inputs also enhances inferences about the results, and provides a range of reasonable results based on variations in model structure, assumptions, and methods of use of the input values. The common input data are updated for each analysis to ensure that they reflect the most current practice and knowledge about breast cancer. The common core of parameters includes population rates of births and deaths; age- and cohort-specific temporal rates of breast cancer incidence in the absence of screening and treatment; effects of risk factors on incidence trends; dissemination of plain film and digital mammography; screening test performance characteristics; stage or size distribution of screen-, interval-, and clinically- detected tumors by age; the joint distribution of ER/HER2 by age and stage; survival in the absence of screening and treatment by stage and molecular subtype; age-, stage-, and molecular subtype-specific therapy; dissemination and effectiveness of therapies over time; and competing non-breast cancer mortality. METHOD AND RESULTS:\nIn this paper, we summarize the methods and results for the common input values presently used in the CISNET breast cancer models, note assumptions made because of unobservable phenomena and/or unavailable data, and highlight plans for the development of future parameters.

We estimated mortality rates due to breast cancer and all other causes combined to determine their impact on overall mortality by year, age, and birth cohort. METHODS:\nBased on mortality rates from publicly available datasets, an age-period-cohort model was used to estimate the proportion of deaths due to breast cancer for US women aged 0 to 119 years, with birth years 1900 to 2000. Breast cancer mortality was calculated as all-cause mortality multiplied by the proportion of deaths due to breast cancer; other-cause mortality was the difference between all-cause and breast cancer mortality. RESULTS:\nBreast cancer and other-cause mortality rates were higher for older ages and birth cohorts. The percent of deaths due to breast cancer increased across birth cohorts from 1900 to 1940 then decreased. Among 50-year-old women, in the 1920 birth cohort, 52 (9.9%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 9.8% to 10.1%) were attributed to breast cancer whereas 476 of 100,000 were due to other causes; in the 1960 birth cohort, 22 (8.5%) of 100,000 deaths (95% CI, 8.3% to 8.7%) were attributed to breast cancer with 242 of 100,000 deaths due to other causes. The percentage of all deaths due to breast cancer was highest (4.1% to 12.9%) for women in their 40s and 50s for all birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS:\nThis study offers evidence that advances in breast cancer screening and treatment have reduced breast cancer mortality for women across the age spectrum, and provides estimates of age-, year- and birth cohort-specific competing mortality rates for simulation models. Other-cause mortality estimates are important in these models because most women die from causes other than breast cancer.","tags":null,"title":"Contribution of Breast Cancer to Overall Mortality for US Women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oguzhan Alagoz","Mehmet Ergun","Mucahit Cevik","Brian Sprague","Denny Fryback","Ronald Gangnon","John Hampton","Tasha Stout","Amy Trentham-Dietz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1522540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522540800,"objectID":"cbb1c44abcafeaa3aade8384403fa25a","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/alagoz-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.682882Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alagoz-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"The University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Epidemiology Simulation Model (UWBCS), also referred to as Model W, is a discrete-event microsimulation model that uses a systems engineering approach to replicate breast cancer epidemiology in the US over time. This population-based model simulates the lifetimes of individual women through 4 main model components: breast cancer natural history, detection, treatment, and mortality. A key feature of the UWBCS is that, in addition to specifying a population distribution in tumor growth rates, the model allows for heterogeneity in tumor behavior, with some tumors having limited malignant potential (i.e., would never become fatal in a woman's lifetime if left untreated) and some tumors being very aggressive based on metastatic spread early in their onset. The model is calibrated to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) breast cancer incidence and mortality data from 1975 to 2010, and cross-validated against data from the Wisconsin cancer reporting system. The UWBCS model generates detailed outputs including underlying disease states and observed clinical outcomes by age and calendar year, as well as costs, resource usage, and quality of life associated with screening and treatment. The UWBCS has been recently updated to account for differences in breast cancer detection, treatment, and survival by molecular subtypes (defined by ER/HER2 status), to reflect the recent advances in screening and treatment, and to consider a range of breast cancer risk factors, including breast density, race, body-mass-index, and the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. Therefore, the model can evaluate novel screening strategies, such as risk-based screening, and can assess breast cancer outcomes by breast cancer molecular subtype.

Evidence suggests that dietary fibre increases gut microbial diversity, which may help prevent colonisation and subsequent infection by MDROs. The aim of the Winning the War on Antibiotic Resistance (WARRIOR) project is to examine associations of dietary fibre consumption with the composition of the gut microbiota and gut colonisation by MDROs. The secondary purpose of the study is to create a biorepository of multiple body site specimens for future microbiota research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:\nThe WARRIOR project collects biological specimens, including nasal, oral and skin swabs and saliva and stool samples, along with extensive data on diet and MDRO risk factors, as an ancillary study of the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW). The SHOW is a population-based health survey collecting data on several different health determinants and outcomes, as well as objective body measurements and biological specimens. WARRIOR participants include 600 randomly selected Wisconsin residents age 18 and over. Specimens are screened for MDRO colonisation and DNA is extracted for 16S ribosomal RNA-based microbiota sequencing. Data will be analysed to assess the relationship between dietary fibre, the gut microbiota composition and gut MDRO colonisation.

Syndecan-1 interacts with constituents in the extracellular matrix, including collagen fibers, and may contribute to cancer cell migration. Thus, the orientation of collagen fibers surrounding ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions and stromal syndecan-1 expression may predict recurrence.Methods: We evaluated collagen fiber alignment and syndecan-1 expression in 227 women diagnosed with DCIS in 1995 to 2006 followed through 2014 (median, 14.5 years; range, 0.7-17.6). Stromal collagen alignment was evaluated from diagnostic tissue slides using second harmonic generation microscopy and fiber analysis software. Univariate analysis was conducted using χ2 tests and ANOVA. The association between collagen alignment z-scores, syndecan-1 staining intensity, and time to recurrence was evaluated using HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Greater fiber angles surrounding DCIS lesions, but not syndecan-1 staining intensity, were related to positive HER2 (P = 0.002) status, comedo necrosis (P = 0.03), and negative estrogen receptor (P = 0.002) and progesterone receptor (P = 0.02) status.

We used simulation modeling to evaluate the potential impact of a hypothetical test that identifies non-progressive DCIS. METHODS:\nA discrete-event model simulated a cohort of U.S. women undergoing digital screening mammography. All women diagnosed with DCIS underwent the hypothetical DCIS prognostic test. Women with test results indicating progressive DCIS received standard breast cancer treatment and a decrement to quality of life corresponding to the treatment. If the DCIS test indicated non-progressive DCIS, no treatment was received and women continued routine annual surveillance mammography. A range of test performance characteristics and prevalence of non-progressive disease were simulated. Analysis compared discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for test scenarios to base-case scenarios without the test. RESULTS:\nCompared to the base case, a perfect prognostic test resulted in a 40% decrease in treatment costs, from $13,321 to $8005 USD per DCIS case. A perfect test produced 0.04 additional QALYs (16 days) for women diagnosed with DCIS, added to the base case of 5.88 QALYs per DCIS case. The results were sensitive to the performance characteristics of the prognostic test, the proportion of DCIS cases that were non-progressive in the model, and the frequency of mammography screening in the population.

Having at least one nearby mammography facility was associated with greater mammography frequency among urban women (1 vs. 0 facilities, odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.47), with similar effects among rural women. Adding more facilities had decreasing marginal effects. Long driving times tended to be associated with lower mammography frequency. We found no effect modification by income, education, or urbanicity. In rural settings, mammography nonuse was higher, facility density smaller, and driving times to facilities were longer. CONCLUSIONS:\nHaving at least one mammography facility near one's home may increase mammography utilization, with decreasing effects per each additional facility.","tags":null,"title":"Geographic access to mammography facilities and frequency of mammography screening","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bin Huang","Elizabeth Pollock","Li Zhu","Jessica Athens","Ronald Gangnon","Rocky Feuer","Thomas Tucker"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1517443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517443200,"objectID":"67d3bcfedf4738c9ada877eccb1ad8dc","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/huang-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.686185Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huang-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo develop a composite Cancer Burden Index and produce 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of uncertainties for the index. METHODS:\nThe Kentucky Cancer Registry has developed a cancer burden Rank Sum Index (RSI) to guide statewide comprehensive cancer control activities. However, lack of interval estimates for RSI limits its applications. RSI also weights individual measures with little inherent variability equally as ones with large variability. To address these issues, a Modified Sum Index (MSI) was developed to take into account of magnitudes of observed values. A simulation approach was used to generate individual and simultaneous 95% CIs for the rank MSI. An uncertainty measure was also calculated. RESULTS:\nAt the Area Development Districts (ADDs) level, the ranks of the RSI and the MSI were almost identical, while larger variation was found at the county level. The widths of the CIs at the ADD level were considerably shorter than those at the county level. CONCLUSION:\nThe measures developed for estimating composite cancer burden indices and the simulated CIs provide valuable information to guide cancer prevention and control effort. Caution should be taken when interpreting ranks from small population geographic units where the CIs for the ranks overlap considerably.","tags":null,"title":"Ranking composite Cancer Burden Indices for geographic regions: point and interval estimates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvia Plevritis","Diego Munoz","Allison Kurian","Tasha Stout","Oguzhan Alagoz","Aimee Near","Sandra Lee","Jereon van den Broek","Xuelin Huang","Clyde Schechter","Brian Sprague","Juhee Song","Harry de Koning","Amy Trentham-Dietz","Nicolien van Ravesteyn","Ronald Gangnon","Young Chandler","Yisheng Li","Cong Xu","Mehmet Ergun","Hui Huang","Don Berry","Jeanne Mandelblatt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"a4d007a081bd164b82002c72e8bafd63","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/plevritis-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.686653Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plevritis-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Importance:\nGiven recent advances in screening mammography and adjuvant therapy (treatment), quantifying their separate and combined effects on US breast cancer mortality reductions by molecular subtype could guide future decisions to reduce disease burden. Objective:\nTo evaluate the contributions associated with screening and treatment to breast cancer mortality reductions by molecular subtype based on estrogen-receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2, formerly HER2 or HER2/neu). Design, Setting, and Participants:\nSix Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Network (CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 using national data on plain-film and digital mammography patterns and performance, dissemination and efficacy of ER/ERBB2-specific treatment, and competing mortality. Multiple US birth cohorts were simulated. Exposures:\nScreening mammography and treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures:\nThe models compared age-adjusted, overall, and ER/ERBB2-specific breast cancer mortality rates from 2000 to 2012 for women aged 30 to 79 years relative to the estimated mortality rate in the absence of screening and treatment (baseline rate); mortality reductions were apportioned to screening and treatment. Results:\nIn 2000, the estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 37% (model range, 27%-42%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2000 of 64 deaths (model range, 56-73) per 100 000 women: 44% (model range, 35%-60%) of this reduction was associated with screening and 56% (model range, 40%-65%) with treatment. In 2012, the estimated reduction in overall breast cancer mortality rate was 49% (model range, 39%-58%) relative to the estimated baseline rate in 2012 of 63 deaths (model range, 54-73) per 100 000 women: 37% (model range, 26%-51%) of this reduction was associated with screening and 63% (model range, 49%-74%) with treatment. Of the 63% associated with treatment, 31% (model range, 22%-37%) was associated with chemotherapy, 27% (model range, 18%-36%) with hormone therapy, and 4% (model range, 1%-6%) with trastuzumab. The estimated relative contributions associated with screening vs treatment varied by molecular subtype: for ER+/ERBB2-, 36% (model range, 24%-50%) vs 64% (model range, 50%-76%); for ER+/ERBB2+, 31% (model range, 23%-41%) vs 69% (model range, 59%-77%); for ER-/ERBB2+, 40% (model range, 34%-47%) vs 60% (model range, 53%-66%); and for ER-/ERBB2-, 48% (model range, 38%-57%) vs 52% (model range, 44%-62%). Conclusions and Relevance:\nIn this simulation modeling study that projected trends in breast cancer mortality rates among US women, decreases in overall breast cancer mortality from 2000 to 2012 were associated with advances in screening and in adjuvant therapy, although the associations varied by breast cancer molecular subtype.","tags":null,"title":"Association of Screening and Treatment With Breast Cancer Mortality by Molecular Subtype in US Women, 2000-2012","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Klein","Kris Lee","John Maynard","Stacy Meuer","Ronald Gangnon","Barbara Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"721a161c20a9ee71ae300d122a099e38","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/klein-2017b/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.687319Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2017b/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose:\nTo determine if skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF), a noninvasive measure of advanced glycation endproducts and oxidative stress in skin is associated with AMD. Methods:\nSIF was measured with the SCOUT DS skin fluorescence spectrometer in a cross-sectional cohort study of 969 persons aged 68 to 102 years from the 1181 who participated in the 25-year follow-up examination in the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES) in 2014 to 2016. The SCOUT DS skin fluorescence spectrometer uses five light-emitting diodes, centered at 375 nm to 456 nm. AMD was assessed by grading of digital color 45° stereoscopic fundus photographs of the macula using the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy grading scheme. Analyses included logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to account for correlation between the eyes of a person. Results:\nThere were data for 1827 eyes for analyses. Early AMD was present in 22% and late AMD in 4% of the eyes. While adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, and history of cardiovascular disease, there were no significant associations of any SIF measure with any AMD or exudative AMD. SIF01 (odds ratio per 1 SD difference on the log scale, 95% confidence interval) (1.66, 1.00-2.74, P = 0.05) and SIF03 (1.81, 1.16-2.81, P = 0.008) were associated with geographic atrophy. Conclusions:\nThere was a suggestive relationship of two SIF measures, SIF01 and SIF03, using different correction factors from the excitation centered at 375 nm, with the prevalence of geographic atrophy in the BDES.

OBJECTIVE:\nLittle is known about biomarkers of type 2 inflammation in early life in relation to asthma inception. We evaluated aeroallergen sensitization, peripheral blood eosinophils, and serum periostin as potential biomarkers of asthma in children. METHODS:\nChildren enrolled in the Childhood Origins of ASThma study were followed prospectively from birth. Blood samples were collected at ages 2, 4, 6, and 11 years, and serum-specific IgE levels, blood eosionophil counts, and periostin levels were measured in 244 children. Relationships among these biomarkers, age, and asthma were assessed. RESULTS:\nSerum periostin levels were approximately 2- to 3-fold higher in children than previously observed adult levels. Levels were highest at 2 years (145 ng/mL), and did not change significantly between 4 and 11 years (128 and 130 ng/mL). Age 2 year periostin level of 150 ng/mL or more predicted asthma at age 6 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). Eosinophil count of 300 cells/μL or more and aeroallergen sensitization at age 2 years were each associated with increased risk of asthma at age 6 years (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.7-6.0 and OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.7-6.3). Children with any 2 of the biomarkers had a significantly increased risk of developing asthma by school age (≥2 biomarkers vs none: OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 2.7-16.0). CONCLUSIONS:\nSerum periostin levels are significantly higher in children than in adults, likely due to bone turnover, which impairs clinical utility in children.

METHODS:\nA total of 217 children were followed prospectively from birth to age 13 years. The etiology and timing of viral wheezing illnesses during the first 3 years of life were assessed along with patterns of allergen sensitization.

The Health and Environmental Exposure Research (HEER) study worked with the Arkansas Central Cancer Registry, Iowa Cancer Registry and Missouri Cancer Registry to obtain names of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer who were willing to be contacted for participation in our case control study. Voter registration lists from Iowa and Missouri were used to randomly select similarly aged women as represented in the case population. Participants were interviewed by telephone to obtain information on known or suspected endometrial risk factors. Urine kits were sent to participants for home collection and returned for analysis. Our case-control study consisted of 631 incident cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed from January 2010 to October 2012 and 879 age-matched population-based controls, ages 18-81 years (mean age 65 years). We quantified cadmium amounts in urine and standardized these values through creatinine adjustment. Using data from all survey completers, we developed a multivariable model for endometrial cancer. Creatinine-adjusted cadmium concentration was added to this model. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for endometrial cancer were calculated. After multivariable adjustment, higher creatinine-adjusted cadmium exposure was associated with a statistically significant increase of endometrial cancer risk (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44). Our results provide evidence that cadmium may increase the risk of endometrial cancer, possibly through estrogenic effects.","tags":null,"title":"Cadmium exposure and endometrial cancer risk: A large midwestern U.S. population-based case-control study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Scott Adams","John Hampton","Amy Trentham-Dietz","Ronald Gangnon","Martin Shafer","Polly Newcomb"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"7a23acc8c3967f0894d514f0377cd1af","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/adams-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.694495Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adams-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Urinary Cadmium and Mammographic Density","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amy Trentham-Dietz","Karla Kerlikowske","Tasha Stout","Diana Miglioretti","Clyde Schechter","Mehmet Ergun","Jereon van den Broek","Oguzhan Alagoz","Brian Sprague","Nicolien van Ravesteyn","Aimee Near","Ronald Gangnon","John Hampton","Young Chandler","Harry de Koning","Jeanne Mandelblatt","Anna Tosteson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477958400,"objectID":"152f1f5fd11d5eb5f2109b8821dc16ce","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/trenthamdietz-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.696897Z","relpermalink":"/publication/trenthamdietz-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Background:\nBiennial screening is generally recommended for average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, but tailored screening may provide greater benefits. Objective:\nTo estimate outcomes for various screening intervals after age 50 years based on breast density and risk for breast cancer. Design:\nCollaborative simulation modeling using national incidence, breast density, and screening performance data. Setting:\nUnited States. Patients:\nWomen aged 50 years or older with various combinations of breast density and relative risk (RR) of 1.0, 1.3, 2.0, or 4.0. Intervention:\nAnnual, biennial, or triennial digital mammography screening from ages 50 to 74 years (vs. no screening) and ages 65 to 74 years (vs. biennial digital mammography from ages 50 to 64 years). Measurements:\nLifetime breast cancer deaths, life expectancy and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), false-positive mammograms, benign biopsy results, overdiagnosis, cost-effectiveness, and ratio of false-positive results to breast cancer deaths averted. Results:\nScreening benefits and overdiagnosis increase with breast density and RR. False-positive mammograms and benign results on biopsy decrease with increasing risk. Among women with fatty breasts or scattered fibroglandular density and an RR of 1.0 or 1.3, breast cancer deaths averted were similar for triennial versus biennial screening for both age groups (50 to 74 years, median of 3.4 to 5.1 vs. 4.1 to 6.5 deaths averted; 65 to 74 years, median of 1.5 to 2.1 vs. 1.8 to 2.6 deaths averted). Breast cancer deaths averted increased with annual versus biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years at all levels of breast density and an RR of 4.0, and those aged 65 to 74 years with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts and an RR of 4.0. However, harms were almost 2-fold higher. Triennial screening for the average-risk subgroup and annual screening for the highest-risk subgroup cost less than $100 000 per QALY gained. Limitation:\nModels did not consider women younger than 50 years, those with an RR less than 1, or other imaging methods. Conclusion:\nAverage-risk women with low breast density undergoing triennial screening and higher-risk women with high breast density receiving annual screening will maintain a similar or better balance of benefits and harms than average-risk women receiving biennial screening.","tags":null,"title":"Tailoring Breast Cancer Screening Intervals by Breast Density and Risk for Women Aged 50 Years or Older: Collaborative Modeling of Screening Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Keith Gennuso","Keith Thraen-Borowski","Ronald Gangnon","Lisa Colbert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475280000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475280000,"objectID":"4eed305f9c8744207df77d508437da8f","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/gennuso-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.70622Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gennuso-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND/AIMS:\nThe purposes of this study were to examine the relationship between various objectively measured sedentary behavior (SB) variables and physical function in older adults, examine the measurement properties of an SB questionnaire, and describe the domains of SB in our sample.

This study investigated recent patterns in DCIS treatment by demographic factors. METHODS:\nData for women diagnosed with DCIS between 1998 and 2011 (n = 416,232) in the National Cancer Data Base were assessed for trends in treatment patterns by age group, calendar year, ancestral/ethnic group, and geographic region. The likelihood of receiving specific treatment modalities was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS:\nDCIS cases were most frequently treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and adjuvant radiation (45.6%). After an initial rise, the use of adjuvant radiation after BCS plateaued at approximately 70% after 2007, with increasing utilization of mastectomy beyond 2005. In addition, there was an increasing trend in postmastectomy reconstruction over time, and women of African ancestry (odds ratio [OR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.72) and Hispanic women (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89) were less likely to undergo reconstruction in comparison with women of European ancestry. A similar trend was observed in contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy utilization, with women of European ancestry having a more rapid rise in the utilization of contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy in comparison with all other ancestral/ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS:\nRecent trends demonstrate a plateau in radiation therapy administration after BCS along with increasing utilization of mastectomy, reconstruction, and contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy. There are substantial differences in treatment utilization according to ancestry/ethnicity and geographical region. Further studies examining patient-physician decision making surrounding DCIS treatment are warranted.","tags":null,"title":"Emerging trends in surgical and adjuvant radiation therapies among women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kerri Howard","Charles Chandler","Yijun Huang","Barbara Klein","Kris Lee","Stacy Meuer","Ron Danis","Lorraine Danforth","Ronald Gangnon","Ronald Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1464739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1464739200,"objectID":"d9742f719201a44df504b8814de2e368","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/howard-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.699915Z","relpermalink":"/publication/howard-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To quantify variation in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) measures of total retinal thickness (top of inner limiting membrane to top of retinal pigment epithelium, RPE) and RPE thickness measures over a 4-week period and by age. METHODS: A total of 76 volunteers aged 40-85 years were seen at three visits over 4 weeks. Two Topcon SD-OCT scans were taken at each visit. Following grid re-centration, total retinal and RPE thickness were determined in nine subfields. Multilevel modeling was used to quantify variance between scans and by age. RESULTS: In the central circle, mean total retinal thickness was 237.9 µm (standard deviation, SD, 23.5 µm) and RPE thickness was 46.0 µm (SD 5.3 µm). Intraclass correlation coefficient in the central circle was 0.988 for total retinal thickness and 0.714 for RPE thickness. Pairwise measures taken within 4 weeks were strongly correlated (p  0.95). Within-subject variation of total retinal thickness increased significantly with age. Subjects in the oldest age group had significantly increased among- and within-subject variability in measures of RPE thickness. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between retinal thickness measures was very high (0.95) over a period of 4 weeks with small changes likely due to variation in measurement. Increasing variability in total retinal and RPE thickness measures with age suggest that the use of more and/or higher quality images to calculate mean thickness to reduce variability may benefit the study of these measures in older persons. This may also impact sample size calculations for future studies of SD-OCT measures in older adults.","tags":null,"title":"Variability in Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography over 4 Weeks by Age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiale Xu","Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"aff79f5504d822b3e3c09524461021ee","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/xu-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.698659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xu-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatial cluster detection is an important tool in many areas such as sociology, botany and public health. Previous work has mostly taken either a hypothesis testing framework or a Bayesian framework. In this paper, we propose a few approaches under a frequentist variable selection framework for spatial cluster detection. The forward stepwise methods search for multiple clusters by iteratively adding currently most likely cluster while adjusting for the effects of previously identified clusters. The stagewise methods also consist of a series of steps, but with a tiny step size in each iteration. We study the features and performances of our proposed methods using simulations on idealized grids or real geographic areas. From the simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed methods in terms of estimation accuracy and power. These methods are applied to the the well-known New York leukemia data as well as Indiana poverty data.","tags":null,"title":"Stepwise and stagewise approaches for spatial cluster detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"3410019ed7e5f7961e0c9431e18ce6db","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/project/cisnet/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cisnet/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["breast cancer","simulation modeling"],"title":"CISNET","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"13635d53ceababa86867829d0cd9ac69","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/project/rankings/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rankings/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"County Health Rankings","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Create a free website with Academic using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio.

OBJECTIVE:\nTo evaluate screening outcomes, taking into account advances in mammography and treatment of breast cancer. DESIGN:\nCollaboration of 6 simulation models using national data on incidence, digital mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality. SETTING:\nUnited States. PATIENTS:\nAverage-risk U.S. female population and subgroups with varying risk, breast density, or comorbidity. INTERVENTION:\nEight strategies differing by age at which screening starts (40, 45, or 50 years) and screening interval (annual, biennial, and hybrid [annual for women in their 40s and biennial thereafter]). All strategies assumed 100% adherence and stopped at age 74 years. MEASUREMENTS:\nBenefits (breast cancer-specific mortality reduction, breast cancer deaths averted, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years); number of mammograms used; harms (false-positive results, benign biopsies, and overdiagnosis); and ratios of harms (or use) and benefits (efficiency) per 1000 screens. RESULTS:\nBiennial strategies were consistently the most efficient for average-risk women. Biennial screening from age 50 to 74 years avoided a median of 7 breast cancer deaths versus no screening; annual screening from age 40 to 74 years avoided an additional 3 deaths, but yielded 1988 more false-positive results and 11 more overdiagnoses per 1000 women screened. Annual screening from age 50 to 74 years was inefficient (similar benefits, but more harms than other strategies). For groups with a 2- to 4-fold increased risk, annual screening from age 40 years had similar harms and benefits as screening average-risk women biennially from 50 to 74 years. For groups with moderate or severe comorbidity, screening could stop at age 66 to 68 years. LIMITATION:\nOther imaging technologies, polygenic risk, and nonadherence were not considered. CONCLUSION:\nBiennial screening for breast cancer is efficient for average-risk populations. Decisions about starting ages and intervals will depend on population characteristics and the decision makers' weight given to the harms and benefits of screening.","tags":null,"title":"Collaborative Modeling of the Benefits and Harms Associated With Different U.S. Breast Cancer Screening Strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicole Rogus-Pulia","Nicole Rusche","Jackie Hind","Jill Zielinski","Ronald Gangnon","Nasia Safdar","JoAnne Robbins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454284800,"objectID":"79b631624402ed7301a367d01379fa19","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/roguspulia-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.700959Z","relpermalink":"/publication/roguspulia-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) are associated with malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and mortality in older adults.

OBJECTIVE:\nWe sought to identify variation in genes with known antiviral and pro-inflammatory functions to identify specific associations with more severe viral respiratory illnesses and the risk of virus-induced exacerbations during the peak fall season. METHODS:\nThe associations between genetic variation at 326 SNPs in 63 candidate genes and 10 phenotypes related to viral respiratory infection and asthma control were examined in 226 children enrolled in the RhinoGen study. Replication of asthma control phenotypes was performed in 2128 children in the Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC). Significant associations in RhinoGen were further validated using virus-induced wheezing illness and asthma phenotypes in an independent sample of 122 children enrolled in the Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) birth cohort study. RESULTS:\nA significant excess of P values smaller than 0.05 was observed in the analysis of the 10 RhinoGen phenotypes. Polymorphisms in 12 genes were significantly associated with variation in the four phenotypes showing a significant enrichment of small P values. Six of those genes (STAT4, JAK2, MX1, VDR, DDX58, and EIF2AK2) also showed significant associations with asthma exacerbations in the COPSAC study or with asthma or virus-induced wheezing phenotypes in the COAST study.

Because low-risk interventions are available to modify oxidized low-density lipoprotein, it is important to examine the relationships between this factor and the incidence of proliferative retinopathy and of macular edema, 2 important causes of visual impairment in people with type 1 diabetes. OBJECTIVE:\nTo determine the association of oxidized low-density lipoprotein with the worsening of diabetic retinopathy and the incidence of proliferative retinopathy and of macular edema. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:\nOf 996 participants with type 1 diabetes in the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, 730 were examined up to 4 times (1990-1992, 1994-1996, 2005-2007, and 2012-2014) over 24 years and had assays of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and fundus photographs gradable for diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Analyses started July 2014 and ended February 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:\nWorsening of diabetic retinopathy, incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and incidence of macular edema as assessed via grading of color stereo film fundus photographs. The levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein collected from serum samples at the time of each examination were measured in 2013 and 2014 from frozen serum. RESULTS:\nThe cohort at baseline had a mean (SD) level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein of 30.0 (8.5) U/L. While adjusting for duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin A1c level, and other factors, we found that neither the level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein at the beginning of a period nor the change in it over a certain period was associated with the incidence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 [95% CI, 0.91-1.35], P = .30; odds ratio [OR], 1.77 [95% CI, 0.99-3.17], P = .06), the incidence of macular edema (HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.83-1.29], P = .74; OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.44-2.61], P = .87), or the worsening of diabetic retinopathy (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.83-1.07], P = .34; OR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.83-2.09], P = .24). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:\nOur findings do not provide evidence for a relationship between increasing levels of serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein and the incidence of macular edema or the worsening of diabetic retinopathy in persons with type 1 diabetes. The potential increase in the HR for incident proliferative retinopathy, with an increase in oxidized low-density lipoprotein level over the preceding period, warrants further investigation of this relationship.","tags":null,"title":"Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein and the Incidence of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Clinically Significant Macular Edema Determined From Fundus Photographs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amy Thomas","Dan Jackson","Mike Evans","Victoria Rajamanickam","Ronald Gangnon","Sean Fain","Ron Sorkness","Adesua Okupa","Alex Thomas","Jim Gern","Rob Lemanske"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1438387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438387200,"objectID":"c9ce144a559b60cd7a801ca3cb5850f7","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/thomas-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.709743Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thomas-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nSex influences the risk of wheezing illnesses and the prevalence of asthma throughout childhood. OBJECTIVE:\nTo better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we analyzed longitudinal relationships between sex, lung physiology, and asthma in the Childhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study. METHODS:\nChildhood Origins of ASThma birth cohort study children were followed prospectively from birth and assessed annually. Results of spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno), mannitol provocation testing, and (3)He gas magnetic resonance imaging were assessed by sex using multivariate models including age, asthma diagnosis, and wheezing histories. RESULTS:\nGirls had higher prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did boys (mean difference, 0.017; 95% CI, 0.000-0.034; P = .05) of equivalent age. Postbronchodilator findings were more pronounced, with boys demonstrating reduced forced expiratory volume in 0.5 seconds/forced vital capacity values than did girls of equivalent age (mean difference, 0.032; 95% CI, 0.014-0.049; P = .0005). Conversely, girls were noted to have higher ventilation defects on (3)He magnetic resonance imaging than did boys (P = .01). No differences were noted in the rate of positive responses to mannitol provocation or Feno measurements. CONCLUSIONS:\nLower airflow values are present by spirometry for prepubertal boys than for age-matched girls; however, greater (3)He ventilation defects were noted in girls. This could represent a greater degree of subclinical air trapping in prepubertal girls because residual volumes are not detected on standard spirometric readings. No differences were noted between the 2 sexes with airway hyperresponsiveness (mannitol provocation testing) or inflammation (Feno). Prospective peripubertal follow-up will determine whether these differences persist or change with the de novo expression and remission of asthma based on sex and age.","tags":null,"title":"Sex-related differences in pulmonary physiologic outcome measures in a high-risk birth cohort","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

METHODS:\nWe developed an age-period-cohort model of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer incidence in U.S. females using cancer registry data. Five functions were included in the model to estimate stage-specific effects for age, premenopausal birth cohorts, postmenopausal birth cohorts, period (for all years of diagnosis), and a mammography period effect limited to women ages ≥ 40 years after 1982. Incidence with and without the mammography period effect was calculated. RESULTS:\nMore recent birth cohorts have elevated underlying risk compared with earlier cohorts for both pre- and postmenopausal women. Comparing models with and without the mammography period effect showed that overall breast cancer incidence would have been 23.1% lower in the absence of mammography in 2010 (95% confidence intervals, 18.8-27.4), including 14.7% (9.5-19.3) lower for invasive breast cancer and 54.5% (47.4-59.6) lower for DCIS. Incidence of distant-staged breast cancer in 2010 would have been 29.0% (13.1-48.1) greater in the absence of mammography screening. CONCLUSIONS:\nMammography contributes to markedly elevated rates of DCIS and early-stage invasive cancers, but also contributes to substantial reductions in the incidence of metastatic breast cancer. IMPACT:\nMammography is an important tool for reducing the burden of breast cancer, but future work is needed to identify risk factors accounting for increasing underlying incidence and to distinguish between indolent and potentially lethal early-stage breast cancers that are detected via mammography.","tags":null,"title":"The contribution of mammography screening to breast cancer incidence trends in the United States: an updated age-period-cohort model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristin Litzelman","Hal Skinner","Ronald Gangnon","Javier Nieto","Kristen Malecki","Whitney Witt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433116800,"objectID":"23ebc0bf33a1f2a157a86c2e609b5878","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/litzelman-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.71245Z","relpermalink":"/publication/litzelman-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nIn order to better understand how family caregiving may contribute to poor health outcomes, this study sought to determine (1) if and to what extent caregiving characteristics were associated with caregiver strain and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and (2) whether caregiver strain mediated this association.

Our objective was to identify sparse environmental variables associated with asthma diagnosis gathered from a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset while controlling for spatial variation. An EHR dataset from the University of Wisconsin's Family Medicine, Internal Medicine and Pediatrics Departments was obtained for 199,220 patients aged 5-50years over a three-year period. Each patient's home address was geocoded to one of 3456 geographic census block groups. Over one thousand block group variables were obtained from a commercial database. We developed a Sparse Spatial Environmental Analysis (SASEA). Using this method, the environmental variables were first dimensionally reduced with sparse principal component analysis. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling was then used to identify block group variables associated with asthma from sparse principal components. The addresses of patients from the EHR dataset were distributed throughout the majority of Wisconsin's geography. Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling captured spatial variation of asthma. Four sparse principal components identified via model selection consisted of food at home, dog ownership, household size, and disposable income variables. In rural areas, dog ownership and renter occupied housing units from significant sparse principal components were associated with asthma. Our main contribution is the incorporation of sparsity in spatial modeling. SASEA sequentially added sparse principal components to Logistic thin plate regression spline modeling. This method allowed association of geographically distributed environmental factors with asthma using EHR and environmental datasets. SASEA can be applied to other diseases with environmental risk factors.","tags":null,"title":"Sparse modeling of spatial environmental variables associated with asthma","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jessica Athens","Pat Remington","Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"25a8f3620737c25472892533e8dfcf98","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/athens-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.705733Z","relpermalink":"/publication/athens-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVES:\nThe University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute has published the County Health Rankings since 2010. These rankings use population-based data to highlight health outcomes and the multiple determinants of these outcomes and to encourage in-depth health assessment for all United States counties. A significant methodological limitation, however, is the uncertainty of rank estimates, particularly for small counties. To address this challenge, we explore the use of longitudinal and pooled outcome data in hierarchical Bayesian models to generate county ranks with greater precision. METHODS:\nIn our models we used pooled outcome data for three measure groups: (1) Poor physical and poor mental health days; (2) percent of births with low birth weight and fair or poor health prevalence; and (3) age-specific mortality rates for nine age groups. We used the fixed and random effects components of these models to generate posterior samples of rates for each measure. We also used time-series data in longitudinal random effects models for age-specific mortality. Based on the posterior samples from these models, we estimate ranks and rank quartiles for each measure, as well as the probability of a county ranking in its assigned quartile. Rank quartile probabilities for univariate, joint outcome, and/or longitudinal models were compared to assess improvements in rank precision. RESULTS:\nThe joint outcome model for poor physical and poor mental health days resulted in improved rank precision, as did the longitudinal model for age-specific mortality rates. Rank precision for low birth weight births and fair/poor health prevalence based on the univariate and joint outcome models were equivalent. CONCLUSION:\nIncorporating longitudinal or pooled outcome data may improve rank certainty, depending on characteristics of the measures selected. For measures with different determinants, joint modeling neither improved nor degraded rank precision. This approach suggests a simple way to use existing information to improve the precision of small-area measures of population health.","tags":null,"title":"Improving the Rank Precision of Population Health Measures for Small Areas with Longitudinal and Joint Outcome Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danielle Schulte","Ajay Sethi","Ronald Gangnon","Megan Duster","Dennis Maki","Nasia Safdar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"ab1ee2c4cc9b999ec2976828652ddfdc","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/schulte-2015/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.702362Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schulte-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"NTRODUCTION:\nCandida species are major causes of healthcare-associated infections with colonization preceding infection. Understanding risk factors for colonization by Candida species is important in prevention. However, data on risk factors for colonization by Candida species alone or with other healthcare-associated pathogens is limited. METHODS:\nFrom 2002 to 2006, 498 patients were enrolled into a prospective cohort study at our institution. Surveillance perirectal, nasal and skin swab samples were obtained upon enrollment. Samples were cultured for the presence of Candida species, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus, and Resistant Gram Negative organisms. Data on demographics, comorbidities, device use, and antibiotic use were also collected for each subject and analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS:\nFactors associated with Candida colonization at admission in univariate analysis included ambulatory status, a history of Candida colonization and the use of antibiotics prior to enrollment. In multivariate analysis, ambulatory status (odds ratio; OR = 0.45, 95 % CI: 0.27-0.73) and fluroquinolone use (OR = 3.01, 95 % CI: 1.80-5.01) were associated with Candida colonization at admission. Factors predicting Candida co-colonization with one or more MDROs at admission in univariate analysis included, older age, malnutrition, days spent in an ICU in the 2 years prior to enrollment, a history of MRSA colonization, and using antibiotics prior to enrollment.

DATA SOURCES:\nThe measure was developed using 149,021 families with children from the National Health Interview Survey, and it was validated using 18,488 families with children from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. STUDY DESIGN:\nWe estimated the marginal probability of unmet health care need due to cost using a bivariate tensor product spline for family income and out-of-pocket health care costs (OOPC; e.g., deductibles, copayments), while adjusting for confounders. Recursive partitioning was performed on these probabilities, as a function of income and OOPC, to establish thresholds demarcating levels of predicted risk. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:\nWe successfully generated a novel measure of financial burden with four categories that were associated with unmet need (vs. low burden: midlow OR: 1.93, 95 percent CI: 1.78-2.09; midhigh OR: 2.78, 95 percent CI: 2.49-3.10; high OR: 4.38, 95 percent CI: 3.99-4.80). The novel burden measure demonstrated significantly better model fit and less underestimation of financial burden compared to an existing measure (OOPC/income ≥ 10 percent). CONCLUSION:\nThe newly developed measure of financial burden establishes thresholds based on different combinations of family income and OOPC that can be applied in future studies of health care utilization and expenditures and in policy development and evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"Development of a novel, objective measure of health care-related financial burden for U.S. families with children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chelsea Myers","Barbara Klein","Ronald Gangnon","Theru Sivakumaran","Sudha Iyengar","Ronald Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1412121600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1412121600,"objectID":"077e4acb0db15b0a427d01d5529e8d5e","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/myers-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.715756Z","relpermalink":"/publication/myers-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo examine the association of current cigarette smoking and pack-years smoked with the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to examine the interactions of current smoking and pack-years smoked with complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) genotype.

The number of US women potentially affected by this legislation is unknown. METHODS:\nWe determined the mammographic breast density distribution by age and body mass index (BMI) using data from 1518 599 mammograms conducted from 2007 through 2010 at mammography facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC). We applied these breast density distributions to age- and BMI-specific counts of the US female population derived from the 2010 US Census and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate the number of US women with dense breasts. RESULTS:\nOverall, 43.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.1% to 43.4%) of women 40 to 74 years of age had heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts, and this proportion was inversely associated with age and BMI. Based on the age and BMI distribution of US women, we estimated that 27.6 million women (95% CI = 27.5 to 27.7 million) aged 40 to 74 years in the United States have heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts. Women aged 40 to 49 years (N = 12.3 million) accounted for 44.3% of this group. CONCLUSION:\nThe prevalence of dense breasts among US women of common breast cancer screening ages exceeds 25 million.

OBJECTIVE To examine the relationships of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction to the 20-year cumulative incidence of early AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal population-based cohort study involved a random sample of 975 persons in the Beaver Dam Eye Study without signs of AMD who participated in the baseline examination in 1988-1990 and up to 4 follow-up examinations in 1993-1995, 1998-2000, 2003-2005, and 2008-2010. EXPOSURES Serum markers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 2, interleukin-6, and white blood cell count), oxidative stress (8-isoprostane and total carbonyl content), and endothelial dysfunction (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1) were measured. Interactions with complement factor H (rs1061170), age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (rs10490924), complement component 3 (rs2230199), and complement component 2/complement factor B (rs4151667) were examined using multiplicative models. Age-related macular degeneration was assessed from fundus photographs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Early AMD defined by the presence of any size drusen and the presence of pigmentary abnormalities or by the presence of large-sized drusen (≥125-μm diameter) in the absence of late AMD. RESULTS The 20-year cumulative incidence of early AMD was 23.0%. Adjusting for age, sex, and other risk factors, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (odds ratio comparing fourth with first quartile, 2.18; P = .005), tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 2 (odds ratio, 1.78; P = .04), and interleukin-6 (odds ratio, 1.78; P = .03) were associated with the incidence of early AMD. Increased incidence of early AMD was associated with soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (odds ratio per SD on the logarithmic scale, 1.21; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We found modest evidence of relationships of serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 2, interleukin-6, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 to the 20-year cumulative incidence of early AMD independent of age, smoking status, and other factors.

The extent to which impaired judgment in performance of daily activities increases fall risk is unclear. OBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether engagement in mobility activities in a risky manner explains the association between declining cognition and rate of falls. DESIGN:\nThis study was a secondary analysis of baseline and prospective data from older adults enrolled in the intervention arm of a randomized clinical trial. METHODS:\nTwo hundred forty-five community-dwelling older adults (79% female; mean age=79 years, SD=8.0) who were at risk for falls received physical, cognitive, and functional evaluations. Cognition was assessed with the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Using interview and in-home assessment data, physical therapists determined whether participants were at risk for falls when performing mobility-related activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Falls were measured prospectively for 1 year using monthly falls diaries. RESULTS:\nDeclining cognition was associated with increased number of mobility activities designated as risky (1.5% of mobility activities performed in a risky manner per SPMSQ point) and with increased rate of falls (rate ratio=1.16 for each unit change in SPMSQ score). Risky performance of mobility activities mediated the relationship between cognition and rate of falls. LIMITATIONS:\nRisk assessment was based on the clinical judgment of experienced physical therapists. Cognition was measured with a relatively insensitive instrument, and only selected mobility activities were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS:\nEngagement in mobility ADL and IADL tasks in a risky manner emerged as a link between declining cognition and increased number of falls, suggesting a mechanism through which the rate of falls may increase. Specifically, declining cognition is associated with performance of mobility activities in an unsafe manner, thereby increasing the risk for falls.","tags":null,"title":"Declining cognition and falls: role of risky performance of everyday mobility activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Gangnon","Kris Lee","Barbara Klein","Sudha Iyengar","Theru Sivakumaran","Ronald Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1393632000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1393632000,"objectID":"693a803d2a2157cf8f3151597790207f","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/gangnon-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.721951Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gangnon-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo investigate the impact of misclassification of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) on the baseline intensity and estimated effects of age, sex, and the Y402H variant in the complement factor H (CFH) gene on incidence, progression, and regression of AMD. METHODS:\nThe Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in the city and township of Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, performed examinations every 5 years during a 20-year period (1988-1990 through 2008-2010). Study participants (N = 4379) aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination had retinal photographs taken at baseline and up to four subsequent examinations. Multistate models with misclassification in continuous time were used to model the effects of age, sex, and CFH genotype on incidence, progression, and regression of AMD and mortality. RESULTS:\nAfter accounting for AMD misclassification, the occurrence of any AMD regression was rare (1%-4%), while it was relatively common (14%-21%) in models that do not account for misclassification. Failure to account for misclassification attenuated estimated age effects on incidence and progression to moderately severe early AMD and attenuated estimated CFH effects on incidence and progressions to moderately severe and severe early AMD. CONCLUSIONS:\nApparent regression of AMD can largely, if not completely, be explained by misclassification.

Short telomeres are also implicated in the incidence of many cancers, but the evidence is not conclusive for colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the association of CRC and telomere length. METHODS: In this case-control study, we measured relative telomere length from peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) DNA with quantitative PCR in 598 CRC patients and 2,212 healthy controls. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis indicated that telomere length was associated with risk for CRC, and this association varied in an age-related manner; younger individuals (≤50 years of age) with longer telomeres (80-99 percentiles) had a 2-6 times higher risk of CRC, while older individuals (50 years of age) with shortened telomeres (1-10 percentiles) had 2-12 times the risk for CRC. The risk for CRC varies with extremes in telomere length in an age-associated manner. CONCLUSIONS: Younger individuals with longer telomeres or older individuals with shorter telomeres are at higher risk for CRC. These findings indicate that the association of PBL telomere length varies according to the age of cancer onset and that CRC is likely associated with at minimum two different mechanisms of telomere dynamics.","tags":null,"title":"The association of telomere length with colorectal cancer differs by the age of cancer onset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaneda Warren Andersen","Amy Trentham-Dietz","Ronald Gangnon","John Hampton","Hal Skinner","Corinne Engelman","Barbara Klein","Linda Titus","Kathleen Egan","Polly Newcomb"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1391212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1391212800,"objectID":"487b9aac190614d97cb656c07a789d98","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/warrenandersen-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.723628Z","relpermalink":"/publication/warrenandersen-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nGenome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with breast cancer risk. Some of these loci have unknown functional significance and may mediate the effects of hormonal exposures on breast cancer risk. We examined relationships between breast cancer susceptibility variants and menstrual/reproductive factors using data from two population-based studies. METHODS:\nThe first analysis was based on a sample of 1328 women age 20-74 who participated as controls in a case-control study of breast cancer conducted in three U.S. states. We evaluated the associations between age at menarche, age at natural menopause and the reproductive lifespan with 13 previously identified breast cancer variants. Associations were also examined with a genetic score created as the sum of at-risk alleles across the 13 variants. For validation, significant results were evaluated in a second dataset comprised 1353 women age 43-86 recruited as part of a cohort study in Wisconsin. RESULTS:\nNeither the genetic score nor any of the 13 variants considered individually were associated with age at menarche or reproductive lifespan. Two SNPs were associated with age at natural menopause; every increase in the minor allele (A) of rs17468277 (CASP8) was associated with a 1.12 year decrease in menopause age (p=0.02). The minor allele (G) of rs10941679 (5p12) was associated with a 1.01 year increase in age at natural menopause (p=0.01). The results were not replicated in the validation cohort (B=-0.61, p=0.14 and B=-0.01, p=.0.98, respectively).

OBJECTIVE:\nTo replicate and determine whether childhood asthma clusters previously identified computationally in the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) are associated with treatment responses in Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network clinical trials. METHODS:\nA cluster assignment model was determined by using SARP participant data. A total of 611 participants 6 to 18 years old from 3 CARE trials were assigned to SARP pediatric clusters. Primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed by cluster in each trial. RESULTS:\nCARE participants were assigned to SARP clusters with high accuracy. Baseline characteristics were similar between SARP and CARE children of the same cluster. Treatment response in CARE trials was generally similar across clusters. However, with the caveat of a smaller sample size, children in the early-onset/severe-lung function cluster had best response with fluticasone/salmeterol (64% vs 23% 2.5× fluticasone and 13% fluticasone/montelukast in the Best ADd-on Therapy Giving Effective Responses trial; P = .011) and children in the early-onset/comorbidity cluster had the least clinical efficacy to treatments (eg, -0.076% change in FEV1 in the Characterizing Response to Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist and Inhaled Corticosteroid trial).

Both paved and unpaved roadways and fire zones in a municipality increased malaria risk. Within the timber production states where 90% of deforestation has occurred, compared with areas without selective logging, municipalities where 0-7% of the remaining forests were selectively logged had the highest malaria risk (1.72, 95% CI 1.18-2.51), and areas with higher rates of selective logging had the lowest risk (0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.67).

In a veteran sample, we examined whether the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, including a modified version, the TUG-Cognition, effectively detected potential fallers whose risk was associated with cognitive deficits. Specifically, we sought to determine whether TUG tasks and AGS criteria were differentially associated with executive dysfunction, whether the TUG tasks identified potential fallers outside of those recognized by AGS criteria, and whether these tasks distinguished groups of fallers. Participants included 120 mostly male patients referred to the Memory Assessment Clinic because of cognitive impairment. TUG-Cognition scores were strongly associated with executive dysfunction and differed systematically between fallers grouped by number of falls. These findings suggest that the TUG-Cognition shows promise in identifying fallers whose risk is related to or compounded by cognitive impairment.

Multivariate regression was used to examine the independent contribution of sociodemographic characteristics, health care factors, patient-provider communication, and respondent language on depression treatment status (none, some, adequate). We found that more than one-third of women with depression in the United States did not receive adequate treatment. Women reporting that providers usually or always listened carefully were more likely to receive adequate treatment (OR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.10-2.30 and OR = 1.55; 95% CI = 1.07-2.23, respectively).

Sleep duration is a novel risk factor for obesity in general populations. OBJECTIVE: We tested the association of sleep duration and asthma characteristics with obesity. METHODS: Adults at tertiary clinics were surveyed on asthma symptoms and habitual sleep duration. Medical records were used to assess asthma severity step (1-4), extract height and weight, current medications and diagnosed comorbid conditions. BMI ≥30 kg/m(2) defined obesity. Habitual sleep was categorized as 8 to ≤9 h (long) and 9 h (very long). Inhaled corticosteroid doses were categorized as low, moderate and high. RESULTS: Among 611 participants (mean BMI 30 ± 8), 249 (41%) were obese. After adjustment for covariates, obesity was associated with short and very long sleep: as compared to normal sleepers, the odds of being obese were on an average 66% higher ([95% CI: 1.07-2.57], p = 0.02) among short and 124% higher ([1.08-1.65], p = 0.03) among very long sleepers, and the association with very short sleep approached significance (1.74 [0.96-3.14], p = 0.06). Obesity was also significantly related to highest asthma step (1.87 [1.09-3.21], p = 0.02) and psychopathology (1.64 [1.08-2.48], p = 0.02), and a trend was seen with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (1.82 [0.93-3.56], p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in asthmatics is associated with shorter and very long sleep duration, worse asthma severity, psychopathology and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Although this cross-sectional study cannot prove causality, we speculate that further investigation of sleep may provide new opportunities to reduce the rising prevalence of obesity among asthmatics.","tags":null,"title":"Sleep duration, asthma and obesity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julie Cunningham","Ruth Johnson","Kristin Litzelman","Hal Skinner","Songwon Seo","Corinne Engelman","Russell Vanderboom","Grace Kimmel","Ronald Gangnon","Douglas Riegert-Johnson","John Baron","John Potter","Robert Haile","Daniel Buchanan","Mark Jenkins","David Rider","Stephen Thibodeau","Gloria Petersen","Lisa Boardman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1383264000,"objectID":"a05064ddc9a74173de501f8757ef2d30","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/cunningham-2013/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.729842Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cunningham-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Both shorter and longer telomeres in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA have been associated with cancer risk.

A polygenic score was created as the sum of risk allele copies multiplied by the corresponding log odds estimate. Logistic regression was used to test the associations between SNPs, the score, reproductive and menstrual factors, and breast cancer risk. Nonlinearity of the score was assessed by the inclusion of a quadratic term for polygenic score.

PARTICIPANTS:\nA total of 1700 persons aged 53 to 96 years who participated in both the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study and the Beaver Dam Eye Study in 1998-2000, with photographs gradable for AMD at 5-year (2003-2005) and 10-year (2008-2010) follow-up examinations. METHODS:\nThe IMT and presence of plaque were assessed using B-mode ultrasonography of the carotid artery. Presence of angina, MI, and stroke were defined on the basis of a self-reported history of physician diagnosis. The presence and severity of AMD were determined by systematic grading of stereoscopic color fundus photographs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nAge-related macular degeneration. RESULTS:\nThe 10-year cumulative incidence of early AMD was 15.7%, and the 10-year cumulative incidence of late AMD was 4.0%. After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) and complement factor H (CFH) genotypes, and other factors, mean IMT was associated with the 10-year incidence of early AMD (odds ratio [OR] per 0.1 mm IMT, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.21; P = 0.03) and late AMD (OR per 0.1 mm IMT, 1.27; CI, 1.10-1.47; P = 0.001). Mean IMT was associated with the 10-year incidence of pure geographic atrophy (OR per 0.1 mm IMT, 1.31; CI, 1.05-1.64; P = 0.02) but not exudative AMD (OR per 0.1 mm IMT, 1.14; CI, 0.97-1.34; P = 0.11). Similar associations were found for maximum IMT. The number of sites with plaque was related to the incidence of late AMD (OR per 0.1 mm IMT, 2.79 for 4-6 sites vs. none; CI, 1.06-7.37; P = 0.04) but not to early AMD. A history of angina, MI, or stroke was not related to any incident AMD outcome. CONCLUSIONS:\nIn these population-based data, carotid artery IMT and carotid plaques had a weak relationship to the incidence of late AMD that was independent of systemic and genetic risk factors. Angina, MI, and stroke were not related to AMD. It is unclear whether the carotid IMT is a risk indicator of processes affecting Bruch's membrane and the retinal pigment epithelium, or a measure of atherosclerosis affecting susceptibility to AMD.","tags":null,"title":"The relationship of atherosclerosis to the 10-year cumulative incidence of age-related macular degeneration: the Beaver Dam studies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Bearden","Cybele Abad","Ronald Gangnon","Jim Sosman","Neil Binkley","Nasia Safdar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1364774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1364774400,"objectID":"e4153200d8d437aa209a0df9699aa686","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/bearden-2013/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.736865Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bearden-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"CONTEXT: Vitamin D is increasingly recognized as an important immunomodulator.

We sought to determine whether there are racial differences in tumor natural history that contribute to these disparities. We used the University of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Simulation Model, a validated member of the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network, to evaluate the contribution of racial differences in tumor natural history to observed disparities in breast cancer incidence. We fit eight natural history parameters in race-specific models by calibrating to the observed race- and stage-specific 1975-2000 U.S. incidence rates, while accounting for known racial variation in population structure, underlying risk of breast cancer, screening mammography utilization, and mortality from other causes. The best fit models indicated that a number of natural history parameters must vary between blacks and whites to reproduce the observed stage-specific incidence patterns. The mean of the tumor growth rate parameter was 63.6 % higher for blacks than whites (0.18, SE 0.04 vs. 0.11, SE 0.02). The fraction of tumors considered highly aggressive based on their tendency to metastasize at a small size was 2.2 times greater among blacks than whites (0.41, SE 0.009 vs. 0.019, SE 0.008). Based on our simulation model, breast tumors in blacks grow faster and are more likely to metastasize earlier than tumors in whites. These differences suggest that targeted prevention and detection strategies that go beyond equalizing access to mammography may be needed to eliminate breast cancer disparities.","tags":null,"title":"Variation in tumor natural history contributes to racial disparities in breast cancer stage at diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tim Chang","Rob Lemanske","Theresa Guilbert","Jim Gern","Michael Coen","Mike Evans","Ronald Gangnon","David Page","Dan Jackson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"48886bc72d180e81f5262586dc27b600","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/chang-2013/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.726566Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chang-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nPrediction of subsequent school-age asthma during the preschool years has proven challenging. OBJECTIVE:\nTo confirm in a post hoc analysis the predictive ability of the modified Asthma Predictive Index (mAPI) ina high-risk cohort and a theoretical unselected population. We also tested a potential mAPI modification with a 2-wheezing episode requirement (m2API) in the same populations. METHODS:\nSubjects (n [ 289) with a family history of allergy and/or asthma were used to predict asthma at age 6, 8, and 11 years with the use of characteristics collected during the first 3 years of life. The mAPI and the m2API were tested for predictive value. RESULTS:\nFor the mAPI and m2API, school-age asthma prediction improved from 1 to 3 years of age. The mAPI had high predictive value after a positive test (positive likelihood ratio ranging from 4.9 to 55) for asthma development at years 6,8, and 11. Lowering the number of wheezing episodes to 2(m2API) lowered the predictive value after a positive test(positive likelihood ratio ranging from 1.91 to 13.1) without meaningfully improving the predictive value of a negative test.Posttest probabilities for a positive mAPI reached 72% and 90%in unselected and high-risk populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:\nIn a high-risk cohort, a positive mAPI greatly increased future asthma probability (eg, 30% pretest probability to 90% posttest probability) and is a preferred predictive test to them 2API. With its more favorable positive posttest probability,the mAPI can aid clinical decision making in assessing future asthma risk for preschool-age children.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of the modified asthma predictive index in high-risk preschool children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ronald Klein","Chelsea Myers","Stacy Meuer","Ronald Gangnon","Theru Sivakumaran","Sudha Iyengar","Kris Lee","Barbara Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362096000,"objectID":"884d4811545b90fb11028f468532435a","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/klein-2013c/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.734881Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2013c/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE:\nTo describe the relationships of risk alleles in complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) to the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) during a 20-year period. METHODS:\nThere were 4282 persons aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination in 1988-1990 enrolled in a population-based cohort study who participated in at least 1 examination spaced 5 years apart during a 20-year period and had gradable fundus photographs for AMD and genotype information on CFH and ARMS2.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MSS rectal cancers from patients ≤50 years old with Stage II (B2 or higher) or Stage III disease were assessed for CIN, telomere length and telomere maintenance mechanism (telomerase activation [TA]; alternative lengthening of telomeres [ALT]). Relative telomere length was measured by qPCR in somatic epithelial and cancer DNA. TA was measured with the TRAPeze assay, and tumors were evaluated for the presence of C-circles indicative of ALT. p53 mutation status was assessed in all available samples. DNA copy number changes were evaluated with Spectral Genomics aCGH.

METHODS:\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy control subjects (N = 93) and asthmatic children of varying disease severity (N = 66) were characterized by multi-parameter flow cytometry. RESULTS:\nOur findings demonstrate that children with asthma had a significantly increased frequency of Treg cells compared to children without asthma. Using a multivariate model, increased Treg cell frequency in children with asthma was most directly associated with inhaled corticosteroid use, and not asthma severity, allergic sensitization, or atopic status of the asthma. CONCLUSION:\nWe conclude that low dose, local airway administration of corticosteroids is sufficient to impact the frequency of Treg cells in the peripheral blood.

Male sex (beta estimate [β] = 5.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.58-6.90), history of current cigarette smoking (β = 9.38; 95% CI, 8.26-10.49), and higher white blood cell (WBC) count (per 1000/μL: β = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74-1.16) were independently associated with larger concurrent CRVE, whereas higher mean arterial blood pressure (per 5 mmHg: β = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.50 to -0.23) and higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (per 10 mg/dl: β = 0.89; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.63) were independently associated with smaller concurrent CRVE. History of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (β = -0.16; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.06) and presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (β = -0.20; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.05) were associated with a greater decrease in CRVE over time. CONCLUSIONS:\nThese data show that retinal venular diameter tends to narrow with age; concurrent venular diameter is independently associated with sex, blood pressure, serum HDL cholesterol, WBC count, and history of current cigarette smoking; and change in CRVE is independently associated with a history of CVD and presence of CKD. The different independent effects of these interrelated factors on CRVE highlight the complex relationship between CRVE and systemic diseases and conditions and the difficulty in determining specific causes of change in CRVE over time.","tags":null,"title":"Determinants of retinal venular diameter: the Beaver Dam Eye Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Barbara Klein","Kerri Howard","Ronald Gangnon","Jennifer Dreyer","Kris Lee","Ronald Klein"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354320000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354320000,"objectID":"00ee5bba2fbbe2a5134bd1edcf672a29","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/klein-2012c/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.740365Z","relpermalink":"/publication/klein-2012c/","section":"publication","summary":"CONTEXT:\nAspirin is widely used for relief of pain and for cardioprotective effects. Its use is of concern to ophthalmologists when ocular surgery is being considered and also in the presence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). OBJECTIVE:\nTo examine the association of regular aspirin use with incidence of AMD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:\nThe Beaver Dam Eye Study, a longitudinal population-based study of age-related eye diseases conducted in Wisconsin. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period (1988-1990 through 2008-2010). Study participants (N = 4926) were aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination. At subsequent examinations, participants were asked if they had regularly used aspirin at least twice a week for more than 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:\nIncidence of early AMD, late AMD, and 2 subtypes of late AMD (neovascular AMD and pure geographic atrophy), assessed in retinal photographs according to the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. RESULTS:\nThe mean duration of follow-up was 14.8 years. There were 512 incident cases of early AMD (of 6243 person-visits at risk) and 117 incident cases of late AMD (of 8621 person-visits at risk) over the course of the study. Regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was associated with late AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.63 [95% CI, 1.01-2.63]; P = .05), with estimated incidence of 1.76% (95% CI, 1.17%-2.64%) in regular users and 1.03% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.51%) in nonusers. For subtypes of late AMD, regular aspirin use 10 years prior to retinal examination was significantly associated with neovascular AMD (HR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.20-4.15]; P = .01) but not pure geographic atrophy (HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.25-1.95]; P = .45). Aspirin use 5 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.71-1.05]; P = .13) or 10 years (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.65-1.13]; P = .28) prior to retinal examination was not associated with incident early AMD. CONCLUSIONS:\nAmong an adult cohort, aspirin use 5 years prior to observed incidence was not associated with incident early or late AMD. However, regular aspirin use 10 years prior was associated with a small but statistically significant increase in the risk of incident late and neovascular AMD.","tags":null,"title":"Long-term use of aspirin and age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wai-Ming Lee","Rob Lemanske","Mike Evans","Fue Vang","Tressa Pappas","Ronald Gangnon","Dan Jackson","Jim Gern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"af0142e38b74840565bc530a146f9fcd","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/lee-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.743657Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lee-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"RATIONALE: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) consist of approximately 160 types that cause a wide range of clinical outcomes, including asymptomatic infections, common colds, and severe lower respiratory illnesses.

Shortened telomeres in pancreatic tissue play a key role in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, and shorter telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) have been associated with increased risk for several cancer types. We hypothesized that shorter blood telomeres are associated with higher risk for pancreatic cancer. METHODS:\nTelomere length was measured in PBLs using quantitative real-time PCR in 499 cases with pancreatic cancer and 963 cancer-free controls from the Mayo Clinic. ORs and confidence intervals (CI) were computed using logistic generalized additive models (GAM) adjusting for multiple variables. RESULTS:\nIn multivariable adjusted models, we observed a significant nonlinear association between telomere length in peripheral blood samples and the risk for pancreatic cancer. Risk was lower among those with longer telomeres compared with shorter telomeres across a range from the 1st percentile to 90th percentile of telomere length. There was also some evidence for higher risk among those with telomeres in the longest extreme. CONCLUSIONS:\nShort telomeres in peripheral blood are associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer across most of the distribution of length, but extremely long telomeres may also be associated with higher risk. IMPACT:\nAlthough the temporality of this relationship is unknown, telomere length may be useful as either a marker of pancreatic cancer risk or of the presence of undetected pancreatic cancer. If telomere shortening precedes cancer incidence, interventions to preserve telomere length may be an effective strategy to prevent pancreatic cancer.","tags":null,"title":"Telomere length and pancreatic cancer: a case-control study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Douglas McMahon","Victoria Rajamanickam","Lisa Salazar","Ronald Gangnon","Jim Gern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"14d5deddcee35d98d845b097b6e6d608","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/mcmahon-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.747729Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcmahon-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Do asthma symptoms lag behind cold symptoms in a viral illness?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasmin Bradfield","Michael Struck","Burt Kushner","Daniel Neely","David Plager","Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"c08bacbdc23402c9f629e1e9424ff16c","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/bradfield-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.741734Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bradfield-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo evaluate the outcomes of Harada-Ito surgery in correcting various types of torsional diplopia. METHODS:\nThe medical records of patients who underwent Harada-Ito surgery at two academic institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included etiology of torsional diplopia, strabismus and torsion measurements, reoperation rate, patient symptoms, and use of prism. Postoperative success was defined as a lack of diplopia in the primary position at distance and downgaze at near with or without prism. Failure was defined as persistent torsional diplopia; partial success was defined as surgical success but with restrictive strabismus in the secondary gaze positions. RESULTS:\nA total of 26 patients (mean age, 46 years; range, 13-89 years) were included. Of these, 17 had superior oblique palsy. The mean follow-up duration was 2 years (range, 2-60 months). The surgical outcome was success in 73% of patients, partial success in 7%, and failure in 19%. All patients with ≤10° of torsion preoperatively obtained surgical success. Patients in the failure group had higher amounts of preoperative torsion compared to the success group (P = 0.009). The reoperation rate was 23%, including four patients with additional surgery for downgaze esotropia or torsion. One-third of the patients wore a prism immediately after surgery.

Cellular damage caused by infection or allergen inhalation increases ATP levels in the airways with subsequent purinergic receptor activation.

OBJECTIVE:\nBased on the P2X(7) knockout mouse, we hypothesized that children with low P2X(7) function would have decreased rates of asthma. METHODS:\nWe used a functional assay to determine P2X(7) pore-producing capacity in whole-blood samples in a birth cohort at high risk for asthma development. The P2X(7) assay was validated with known loss-of-function alleles in human subjects. P2X(7) pore status categorization was used to assess asthma and allergy status in the cohort. RESULTS:\nAttenuated P2X(7) function was associated with lower asthma rates at ages 6 and 8 years, and the greatest effects were observed in boys. Children with asthma at age 11 years who had low P2X(7) capacity had less severe disease in the previous year.

METHODS: We linked breast cancer cases who reported having a valid driver's license from the 2004-2008 Wisconsin women's health study (N = 2,988) with a master list of licensed drivers from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WDOT). This master list excludes Wisconsin drivers that requested their information not be sold by the state.

It is based on the simultaneous evaluation of the statistical significance of the maximum likelihood ratio test statistic over a large collection of potential clusters. In most cluster detection problems, there is variation in the extent of local multiplicity across the study region. For example, using a fixed maximum geographic radius for clusters, urban areas typically have many overlapping potential clusters, whereas rural areas have relatively few. The spatial scan statistic does not account for local multiplicity variation. We describe a previously proposed local multiplicity adjustment based on a nested Bonferroni correction and propose a novel adjustment based on a Gumbel distribution approximation to the distribution of a local scan statistic. We compare the performance of all three statistics in terms of power and a novel unbiased cluster detection criterion.

OBJECTIVE:\nTo define the developmental relationship between aeroallergen sensitization and virus-induced wheezing. METHODS:\nA total of 285 children at high risk for allergic disease and asthma were followed prospectively from birth. The timing and etiology of viral respiratory wheezing illnesses were determined, and aeroallergen sensitization was assessed annually for the first 6 years of life. The relationships between these events were assessed using a longitudinal multistate Markov model. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:\nChildren who were sensitized to aeroallergens had greater risk of developing viral wheeze than nonsensitized children (hazard ratio [HR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.1). Allergic sensitization led to an increased risk of wheezing illnesses caused by human rhinovirus (HRV) but not respiratory syncytial virus. The absolute risk of sensitized children developing viral wheeze was greatest at 1 year of age; however, the relative risk was consistently increased at every age assessed. In contrast, viral wheeze did not lead to increased risk of subsequent allergic sensitization (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.50-1.1). CONCLUSIONS:\nProspective, repeated characterization of a birth cohort demonstrated that allergic sensitization precedes HRV wheezing and that the converse is not true. This sequential relationship and the plausible mechanisms by which allergic sensitization can lead to more severe HRV-induced lower respiratory illnesses support a causal role for allergic sensitization in this developmental pathway. Therefore, therapeutics aimed at preventing allergic sensitization may modify virus-induced wheezing and the development of asthma.","tags":null,"title":"Evidence for a causal relationship between allergic sensitization and rhinovirus wheezing in early life","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jackie Hind","Elizabeth Divyak","Jill Zielinski","Andrew Taylor","Michael Hartman","Ronald Gangnon","JoAnne Robbins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"07cb69115494a1c667b410dde2136845","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/hind-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.737919Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hind-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"This study measured dose-response of a range of commercially available liquid barium materials designed for use in videofluoroscopic oropharyngeal swallowing assessments, particularly as they relate to the necessity of adding a thickening agent for swallow safety.

However, there is little epidemiologic data exploring the effects of vitamin D on breast cancer risk in the context of these other molecules. We examined a panel of molecules in the vitamin D pathway in relation to mammographic breast density, a marker of breast cancer risk, in the Wisconsin Breast Density Study. A total of 238 postmenopausal women (ages 55-70, with no history of postmenopausal hormone use) were enrolled from mammography clinics in Madison, Wisconsin. Subjects provided blood samples that were analyzed for levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], PTH, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), retinol, and calcium. Percent breast density was measured using Cumulus software. In age-adjusted analyses there was a positive association between 25(OH)D and percent breast density (P = 0.05; mean percent density = 11.3% vs. 15.6% for 1st vs. 4th quartile of 25(OH)D). Breast density was inversely associated with PTH (P = 0.05; 16.0% vs. 11.4% for Q1 vs. Q4) and positively associated with the IGF-1:IGFBP-3 molar ratio (P = 0.02; 11.9% vs. 15.6% for Q1 vs. Q4). However, these associations were all null after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI; P  0.25). The independent relation between 25(OH)D and breast density remained null among subgroups defined by BMI and serum levels of retinol, calcium, and estradiol. These results suggest no strong independent associations between the circulating molecules of the vitamin D pathway and mammographic breast density in postmenopausal women. While it remains possible that vitamin D could influence breast cancer risk, our results suggest that such an effect would be mediated through pathways other than breast density.","tags":null,"title":"The vitamin D pathway and mammographic breast density among postmenopausal women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matt Tattersall","Ronald Gangnon","Kunal Karmali","Jon Keevil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"054db61d977576426e981facda251e0b","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/tattersall-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.742333Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tattersall-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nThe Reynolds Risk Score (RRS) is one alternative to the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) for cardiovascular risk assessment. The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) integrated the FRS a decade ago, but with the anticipated release of ATP IV, it remains uncertain how and which risk models will be integrated into the recommendations. We sought to define the effects in the United States population of a transition from the FRS to the RRS for cardiovascular risk assessment. METHODS:\nUsing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, we assessed FRS and RRS in 2,502 subjects representing approximately 53.6 Million (M) men (ages 50-79) and women (ages 45-79), without cardiovascular disease or diabetes. We calculated the proportion reclassified by RRS and the subset whose LDL-C goal achievement changed. RESULTS:\nCompared to FRS, the RRS assigns a higher risk category to 13.9% of women and 9.1% of men while assigning a lower risk to 35.7% of men and 2% of women. Overall, 4.7% of women and 1.1% of men fail to meet newly intensified LDL-C goals using the RRS. Conversely, 10.5% of men and 0.6% of women now meet LDL-C goal using RRS when they had not by FRS. CONCLUSION:\nIn the U.S. population the RRS assigns a new risk category for one in six women and four of nine men. In general, women increase while men decrease risk. In conclusion, adopting the RRS for the 53.6 million eligible U.S. adults would result in intensification of clinical management in 1.6 M additional women and 2.10 M fewer men.","tags":null,"title":"Women up, men down: the clinical impact of replacing the Framingham Risk Score with the Reynolds Risk Score in the United States population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Georgia Malandraki","Jackie Hind","Ronald Gangnon","Jeri Logemann","JoAnne Robbins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1320105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1320105600,"objectID":"92fcfc27f7740f0b8955e650a655404e","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/malandraki-2011/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.755147Z","relpermalink":"/publication/malandraki-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo evaluate the utility of a pitch elevation task in the assessment of oropharyngeal dysphagia.

In-person interviewer-assisted surveys assessed sociodemographics, psychosocial factors, and QOL. Child clinical characteristics were obtained through medical record abstraction. Regressions were performed to determine factors related to parental QOL. RESULTS: Children's activity limitation and active treatment status were associated with worse parental mental QOL (5.4 and 4.4 points lower, respectively; P 0.05 for all child characteristics). CONCLUSIONS: While child clinical characteristics appear to be related to poor parental QOL, this relationship was mediated by caregiver burden and stress.

Despite frequent use, the survival advantage conferred on patients with stage II disease by chemotherapy is yet unproven. We sought to determine the overall survival benefit of chemotherapy among patients with stage II colon cancer having poor prognostic features. PATIENTS AND METHODS:\nA total of 43,032 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent colectomy for stage II and III primary colon adenocarcinoma diagnosed from 1992 to 2005 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) -Medicare database. χ(2) and two-way analysis of variance were used to assess differences in patient- and disease-related characteristics. Five-year overall survival was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression with propensity score weighting. RESULTS:\nOf the 24,847 patients with stage II cancer, 75% had one or more poor prognostic features. Adjuvant chemotherapy was received by 20% of patients with stage II disease and 57% of patients with stage III disease. After adjustment, 5-year survival benefit from chemotherapy was observed only for patients with stage III disease (hazard ratio[HR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.67).

OBJECTIVE:\nTo investigate the genetic architecture of sex differences in asthma risk, we evaluated (1) associations between polymorphisms in the IFNG gene and childhood-onset asthma in combined and sex-specific samples and (2) interactions between polymorphisms and sex on asthma risk. METHODS:\nMain and sex-interaction effects of IFNG genetic diversity on asthma risk and IFN-γ levels were examined in a birth cohort of children at high risk for asthma and allergic diseases. Replication of the genetic association was assessed in an independent sample of asthma cases. RESULTS:\nSignificant genotype-sex interactions on asthma were observed for 2 IFNG single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs2069727 and rs2430561, which were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. In contrast, none of the 10 IFNG single nucleotide polymorphisms showed significant main effects on asthma. The observed genotype-sex interaction on asthma was characterized by nonadditivity; that is, heterozygous boys had the highest risk for asthma, and heterozygous girls had the lowest risk. The interaction effect was robust to other asthma risk factors but was limited to children who experienced wheezing illnesses with viral infections during the first 3 years of life. Genotype-sex interactions were also observed in the IFN-γ response to LPS in the first year of life.

High blood levels of endogenous estrogens and androgens are associated with increased risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women. We sought to examine whether these hormones are also associated with breast density. The Wisconsin Breast Density Study enrolled 257 postmenopausal women, ages 55-70 years, with no history of postmenopausal hormone use, from mammography clinics in Madison, Wisconsin. Subjects provided a blood sample for sex hormone analysis, and breast density was measured from subjects' screening mammograms using a computer-assisted thresholding method. Numerous sex hormones were associated with breast density in age-adjusted analyses. However, further adjustment for body mass index and other potentially confounding factors substantially attenuated or eliminated these associations. In the fully adjusted model, there remained a positive association between percent breast density and serum progesterone (P=0.03), with percent density rising from 11.9% (95% CI: 9.8, 14.1%) among women in the lowest quartile of serum progesterone to 15.4% (12.9, 18.2%) among women in the highest quartile. There was also a positive association between sex hormone binding globulin and percent breast density (P=0.06). In contrast, there were no independent associations between percent breast density and estradiol (total, free, or bioavailable), estrone, estrone sulfate, or testosterone (total, free, or bioavailable). These results suggest that breast density has a hormonal etiology; however, it may differ in important ways from that of breast cancer risk.","tags":null,"title":"Circulating sex hormones and mammographic breast density among postmenopausal women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matt Tattersall","Kunal Karmali","Ronald Gangnon","Jon Keevil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"1e85c4efa9109720870463b7f548cee7","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/tattersall-2011/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.757896Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tattersall-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The Framingham Global Cardiovascular Disease (FRS-CVD) risk assessment is a proposed alternative for the assessment of hard coronary heart disease (FRS-CHD) event risk.

OBJECTIVE:\nWe sought to examine weight status from birth to age 5 years in relation to the occurrence of asthma at ages 6 and 8 years. METHODS:\nTwo hundred eighty-five full-term high-risk newborns with at least 1 asthmatic/atopic parent enrolled in the Childhood Origin of Asthma project were studied from birth to age 8 years. Overweight was defined by weight-for-length percentiles of greater than the 85th percentile before the age of 2 years and a body mass index percentile of greater than the 85th percentile at ages 2 to 5 years. RESULTS:\nNo significant concurrent association was found between overweight status and wheezing/asthma occurrence at each year of age. In contrast, longitudinal analyses revealed complex relationships between being overweight and asthma. Being overweight at age 1 year was associated with a decreased risk of asthma at age 6 (odds ratio [OR], 0.32; P = .02) and 8 (OR, 0.35; P = .04) years, as well as better lung function. However, being overweight beyond infancy was not associated with asthma occurrence.

In this paper, we describe an extension of the Gangnon-Clayton model for spatial clustering to spatio-temporal data. As in the purely spatial model, a large set of circular regions of varying radii centered at observed locations are considered as potential clusters, e.g. subregions with a different pattern of risk than the remainder of the study region. Within the spatio-temporal model, no specific parametric form is imposed on the temporal pattern of risk within each cluster. In addition to the clusters, the proposed model incorporates spatial and spatio-temporal heterogeneity effects and can readily accommodate regional covariates. Inference is performed in a Bayesian framework using MCMC. Although formal inferences about the number of clusters could be obtained using a reversible jump MCMC algorithm, we use local Bayes factors from models with a fixed, but overly large, number of clusters to draw inferences about both the number and the locations of the clusters. We illustrate the approach with two applications of the model to data on female breast cancer mortality in Japan and evaluate its operating characteristics in a simulation study.","tags":null,"title":"A model for space-time cluster detection using spatial clusters with flexible temporal risk patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mihaela Teodorescu","David Polomis","Stephanie Hall","Mihai Teodorescu","Ronald Gangnon","Andrea Peterson","Ailiang Xie","Chris Sorkness","Nizar Jarjour"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1283299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1283299200,"objectID":"0cde48fb9f1e94f92978a3d20139995b","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/teodorescu-2010/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.765979Z","relpermalink":"/publication/teodorescu-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may lead to poor asthma control despite optimal therapy. Our objective was to evaluate the relationship between OSA risk and asthma control in adults. METHODS: Patients with asthma seen routinely at tertiary-care clinic visits completed the validated Sleep Apnea Scale of the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (SA-SDQ) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). An ACQ score of or= 1.5 defined not-well-controlled asthma, and an SA-SDQ score of or= 36 for men and or= 32 for women defined high OSA risk. Logistic regression was used to model associations of high OSA risk with not-well-controlled asthma (ACQ full version and short versions). RESULTS: Among 472 subjects with asthma, the mean +/- SD ACQ (full version) score was 0.87 +/- 0.90, and 80 (17%) subjects were not well controlled. Mean SA-SDQ score was 27 +/- 7, and 109 (23%) subjects met the definition of high OSA risk. High OSA risk was associated, on average, with 2.87-times higher odds for not-well-controlled asthma (ACQ full version) (95% CI, 1.54-5.32; P = .0009) after adjusting for obesity and other factors known to worsen asthma control. Similar independent associations were seen when using the short ACQ versions. CONCLUSIONS: High OSA risk is significantly associated with not-well-controlled asthma independent of known asthma aggravators and regardless of the ACQ version used.

We hypothesized that levels of circulating IgA in early childhood would be inversely related to the number of respiratory infections and the risk of becoming sensitized to allergens. Immunoglobulin levels were analyzed (ELISA) in plasma samples (IgG, IgA), and in nasal secretions (IgA) from children participating in a high-risk birth cohort study. Samples were available from 264 children at age 2 yr and 257 children at age 4 yr, and results were compared to rates of respiratory illnesses, allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis (AD), and asthma. Children who were sensitized to allergens had higher rather than lower levels of circulating IgA. A subgroup analysis showed that IgA levels were increased in relationship to foods sensitization (58 vs. 50 mg/dl, p = 0.003) but not aeroallergen sensitization (52 vs. 53 mg/dl, p = 0.11). IgA levels in the plasma correlated with levels of IgE levels (r(s) =0.19, p = 0.003). Levels of IgE, but not IgG or IgA, were positively correlated with rates of respiratory illnesses, AD, and the risk of developing asthma. Finally, there were no significant relationships between IgA in nasal secretions and infectious outcomes. In conclusion, low-normal concentrations of plasma IgA are associated with a reduced prevalence of allergic sensitization in infancy. Further, levels of IgA and IgG in plasma within the range of normal, and IgA in nasal secretions, do not appear to influence the risk of subsequent respiratory illnesses. Further studies to define relationships between IgA and allergic sensitization are likely to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of allergic diseases in infancy.","tags":null,"title":"The relationships among immunoglobulin levels, allergic sensitization, and viral respiratory illnesses in early childhood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephanie Kays","Jackie Hind","Ronald Gangnon","JoAnne Robbins"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1280620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1280620800,"objectID":"c34cbb40c6aeafedf24817a7ee107ae0","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/kays-2010/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.763511Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kays-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nThe purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that eating a meal reduces tongue strength and endurance in healthy old and young adults.

This pilot study of 24 young (45-64 years) and old (65+years) men and women was designed to assess radiographic esophageal bolus movement patterns in healthy adults using videofluoroscopic recording. Healthy, asymptomatic adults underwent videofluoroscopic esophagram to evaluate for the presence of ineffective esophageal clearance, namely, intraesophageal stasis and intraesophageal reflux. Intraesophageal stasis and intraesophageal reflux were visualized radiographically in these normal subjects. Intraesophageal stasis occurred significantly more frequently with semisolid (96%) compared with liquid (16%) barium, suggesting that a variety of barium consistencies, as opposed to only the traditional fluids, would better define the spectrum of esophageal transport. Intraesophageal reflux was observed more frequently in older males than in their younger counterparts. The rates of intraesophageal stasis and intraesophageal reflux were potentially high given that successive bolus presentations were spaced 10 seconds apart. These findings suggest a need for a more comprehensive definition regarding the range of normal esophageal bolus transport to (a) prevent misdiagnosis of dysphagia and (b) to enhance generalization to functional eating, which involves solid foods in addition to liquids.","tags":null,"title":"Esophageal clearance patterns in normal older adults as documented with videofluoroscopic esophagram","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carey Gleason","Ronald Gangnon","Barbara Fischer","Jane Mahoney"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"2d6b64bb9d04b2340d138777334d87df","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/gleason-2009/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.774572Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gleason-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND/AIMS:\nHaving dementia increases patients' risk for accidental falls.

METHODS:\nIn a secondary analysis of the Kenosha County Falls Prevention Study, a randomized controlled trial targeting older adults at risk for falls, we examined the association between baseline MMSE and prospective rate of falls over 12 months in 172 subjects randomized to control group.

METHODS:\nFrom the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), mean baseline VA scores were tabulated for 7422 eyes cross-classified by (1) location of retinal thickening (RT) and its area within 1 disc diameter of the macular center, and (2) degree of RT at the center. Adjacent (row, column, and off-diagonal) cells with the greatest similarity in baseline VA (mean and SD) based on a Gaussian (normal) likelihood were merged. An initial eight-step scale was chosen using the Schwarz criterion (Bayesian information criterion; BIC) and was revised based on clinical judgment to nine steps.

METHODS:\nMembers of families in which hereditary spherocytosis exists were systematically questioned about adverse vascular events. RESULTS:\nThe cumulative incidence of arterial and venous events at age 70 years was greater in persons who had undergone a splenectomy for spherocytosis (arterial, 22% females, 32% males; venous, 20% females, 19% males) than in affected persons who did not undergo splenectomy (arterial, 3% females, 2% males; venous, 6% females, 4% males) or non-affected family members (arterial, 10% females, 17% males; venous, 4% females, 12% males). Affected subjects who undergo splenectomy are at greatly increased risk of arterial events as compared to affected subjects who do not undergo splenectomy [arterial, hazard ratio (HR) 7.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.8-17.2; venous, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.8].

The ATP III guidelines intensified LDL-C targets and defined additional high-risk conditions. These recommendations are expected to have a noticeable impact on US cholesterol levels. METHODS: Coronary heart disease (CHD) risk was determined per ATP III guidelines for US residents aged 20 to 79 years in the 1999 to 2000 and 2001 to 2002 surveys. For those at high risk, the LDL-C mean percentage or =130 mg/dL, although not taking lipid-lowering therapy, were compared between the 2 surveys. In addition, subsets with and without CHD were evaluated. RESULTS: Of all high-risk US residents, the mean LDL-C dropped from 129 mg/dL in 1999 to 2000 to 120 mg/dL in 2001 to 2002 (P = .003).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with myeloma were enrolled and treated with melphalan 200 mg/m(2) followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Thalidomide 50 mg per day was started on day  or = 60 after recovery of blood counts and was escalated to a maximum dose of 200 mg per day.

Among 31 patients receiving thalidomide, complete or very good partial responses were observed in 65% and 42% of patients at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Tolerability was a major issue, with only 17 patients completing 1 year of thalidomide. The goal of dosing 200 mg per day was achieved in just 17 of 31 patients, and the median tolerated thalidomide dose was 100 mg per day. Sensory neuropathy was the primary reason for dose modification and discontinuation. No thromboembolic events were observed. The median PFS was 20.8 months, and the median OS was  60 months.

DESIGN:\nPopulation-based study. PARTICIPANTS:\nMembers of the Beaver Dam Eye Study cohort. METHODS:\nSubjects were seen in study offices for examinations (slit lamp, checking for occludable angles, dilation of pupils, lens photographs, measurement of blood pressures, and study interview). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nLens photographs were taken with specially modified cameras that have been maintained over the course of all study examinations. Photographs were graded according to standard protocols that have been continued throughout all the examinations. RESULTS:\nCumulative incidence of nuclear cataract was 29.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.0-31.4); cortical cataract, 22.9% (95% CI, 21.3-24.5); PSC, 8.4% (95% CI, 7.4-9.4); and cataract surgery, 17.7% (95% CI, 16.4-19.0). The cumulative incidence increased with age and was greater for women after accounting for competing events. The relationship between age and incidence of cataracts was quadratic for nuclear cataract, cubic for cortical cataract, and linear for PSC. For persons with similar ages at time of examination, those in more recent birth cohorts were less likely to have any type of prevalent cataract; the effect was significant for nuclear cataract and for cataract surgery, and the effect persisted after controlling for relevant confounders. There were apparent cohort effects on cataract incidence. CONCLUSIONS:\nAge-adjusted incidence of all cataract types increased with increasing age, although the age effect was not linear for all 3 types. More recent birth cohorts are relatively protected relative to persons born earlier.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES; 1999 to 2002) included 7,399 subjects who represented 171 million United States residents aged 20 to 79 years. Subjects were risk stratified according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Subjects with CRP levels 3 mg/L then had their risk profiles adjusted by adding 1 risk factor and multiplying their Framingham risk scores by 1.5. Subjects had their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals adjusted as necessary and were then recategorized as above or below their CRP-adjusted LDL cholesterol goal. LDL cholesterol goals were met initially by 67.8% (116 +/- 8 million) of United States residents, and 64.8% (111 +/- 8 million) achieved their LDL cholesterol goals after CRP adjustment. Thus, 5.3 +/- 1.1 million of the population (3.1 +/- 0.1%) had their risk modified in a clinically meaningful way by CRP adjustment. Targeting the screening to 2 groups, those with 1 risk factor and LDL cholesterol levels 130 to 159 mg/dl and those with moderately high risk and LDL cholesterol levels 100 to 129 mg/dl, we were able to identify all 5.3 million by screening only 14.8 million, achieving a screening yield of 35%. In conclusion, population-based screening with CRP provided a clinical impact for only 3.1% of United States residents.

INTERVENTION:\nSubjects received two in-home visits from a trained nurse or physical therapist who assessed falls risk factors using an algorithm. The intervention consisted of recommendations to the subject and their primary physician, referrals to physical therapy and other providers, 11 monthly telephone calls, and a balance exercise plan. Control subjects received a home safety assessment. MEASUREMENTS:\nThe primary outcome was rate of falls per year in the community. Secondary outcomes included all-cause hospitalizations and nursing home admissions per year. RESULTS:\nThere was no difference in rate of falls between the intervention and control groups (rate ratio (RR)=0.81, P=.27). Nursing home days were fewer in the intervention group (10.3 vs 20.5 days, P=.04). Intervention subjects with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 27 or less had a lower rate of falls (RR=0.55; P=.05) and, if they lived with someone, had fewer hospitalizations (RR=0.44, P=.05), nursing home admissions (RR=0.15, P=.003), and nursing home days (7.5 vs 58.2, P=.008).

This study presents methods to identify geographic disparities in the early detection of breast cancer. METHODS:\nData for all women residing in Dane County, Wisconsin, at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis from 1981 through 2000 (N = 4769) were obtained from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System (Wisconsin's tumor registry) by ZIP code of residence. Hierarchical logistic regression models for disease mapping were used to identify geographic differences in the early detection of breast cancer. RESULTS:\nThe percentage of breast cancer cases diagnosed in situ (excluding lobular carcinoma in situ) increased from 1.3% in 1981 to 11.9% in 2000. This increase, reflecting increasing mammography use, occurred sooner in Dane County than in Wisconsin as a whole. From 1981 through 1985, the proportion of breast cancer diagnosed in situ in Dane county was universally low (2%-3%). From 1986 through 1990, urban and suburban ZIP codes had significantly higher rates (10%) compared with rural ZIP codes (5%). From 1991 through 1995, mammography screening had increased in rural ZIP codes (7% of breast cancer diagnosed in situ). From 1996 through 2000, mammography use was fairly homogeneous across the entire county (13%-14% of breast cancer diagnosed in situ). CONCLUSION:\nThe percentage of breast cancer cases diagnosed in situ increased in the state and in all areas of Dane County from 1981 through 2000.

A substantial number of these fractures are demonstrable using instant vertebral assessment with Hologic densitometers. Whether similar recognition is possible using dual-energy lateral vertebral assessment (LVA) with GE Lunar densitometers remains uncertain. Thus, we evaluated the ability of clinicians using LVA to detect prevalent vertebral fractures. Dual-energy LVA and conventional thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were concurrently obtained in 80 postmenopausal women. Using an established visual semiquantitative system, vertebral fractures were identified individually by two non-radiologist clinicians on LVA images, and the results were compared with spinal radiograph evaluation by an expert radiologist. Using LVA, 95% of vertebral bodies from T7 through L4 were evaluable, but a majority (66%) of vertebrae from T4 to T6 were not adequately visualized. In the LVA-evaluable vertebrae, prevalent fractures were identified in 40 vertebral bodies by radiography. In this regard, the clinicians using LVA detected 17 of 18 radiographically evident vertebral fractures of grade 2 or 3, a false negative rate of 6%. They identified 50% (11/22) of grade 1 fractures. Additionally, the vast majority of evaluable non-fractured vertebrae, (764/794, 96.2%) were correctly classified as normal by LVA. Thus, clinicians utilizing LVA correctly identified the vast majority of grade 2 or 3 vertebral compression fractures and normal vertebral bodies, although detection of grade 1 fractures was less effective. In conclusion, the low-radiation, dual-energy LVA technique provides a rapid and convenient way for clinicians to identify patients with, and without, grade 2 or 3 vertebral fractures, thereby enhancing care of osteoporotic patients.","tags":null,"title":"Lateral vertebral assessment: a valuable technique to detect clinically significant vertebral fractures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dinny Davis","Ronald Gangnon","Li-Yin Lee","Larry Hubbard","Barbara Klein","Ronald Klein","Rick Ferris","Susan Bressler","Roy Milton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1130803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1130803200,"objectID":"ec48c5f5f635bac78b9f1e60e05b0120","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/davis-2005/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.797141Z","relpermalink":"/publication/davis-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE:\nTo develop a fundus photographic severity scale for age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Consequently wheezing illnesses, viral respiratory pathogen identification, and in vitro cytokine response profiles were comprehensively evaluated from birth to 3 years of age, and associations of the observed phenotypes with genetic polymorphisms were investigated. RESULTS:\nFor the entire cohort, cytokine responses did not develop according to a strict T helper cell 1 or T helper cell 2 polarization pattern during infancy. Increased cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutin-induced interferon-gamma responses of mononuclear cells were associated with decreased numbers of moderate to severe viral infections during infancy, especially among subjects with the greatest exposure to other children. In support of the hygiene hypothesis, an increased frequency of viral infections in infancy resulted in increased mitogen-induced interferon-gamma responses at 1 year of age. First year wheezing illnesses caused by respiratory viral infection were the strongest predictor of subsequent third year wheezing. Also, genotypic variation interacting with environmental factors, including day care, was associated with clinical and immunologic phenotypes that may precede the development of asthma. CONCLUSIONS:\nAssociations between clinical wheezing, viral identification, specific cytokine responses and genetic variation provide insight into the immunopathogenesis of childhood asthma and allergic diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Viral infections, cytokine dysregulation and the origins of childhood asthma and allergic diseases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasmin Bradfield","Burt Kushner","Ronald Gangnon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1128124800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1128124800,"objectID":"fe740677cf0f888ee0902fbec3478dba","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/bradfield-2005/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.797705Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bradfield-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Organ and bone marrow transplantation commonly are performed in children. Ocular complications usually are described as secondary to post-transplantation medications. The complication rate is unknown. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 93 children who were younger than 18 years of age and had transplantation surgery from 1989 to 2004. The rate and type of ocular complications, including those requiring ocular surgery, were analyzed. Medications and visual loss associated with adverse effects also were studied. RESULTS: Of the 93 patients, 74 patients met the entry criteria. Sixty-one patients had at least 1 year of follow-up, and the longest follow-up duration was 14 years. The 1-year post-transplantation complication rate was 16.0% (95% confidence interval 6.8-24.4%). Adverse effects included cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, cataract, graft-versus-host disease, lymphoproliferative disorder, persistent strabismus, and transient visual loss. Four patients underwent eye surgery, including lensectomy for cataract, tarsorrhaphy for corneal ulcer, and iris biopsy. They had surgery 0.9 to 4.7 years after transplantation. Most patients were taking prednisone and cyclosporine when their complication was diagnosed. One patient's visual acuity deteriorated to no light perception in one eye and 20/250 in the other eye secondary to CMV retinitis. Most patients had a final visual acuity  or =20/40. CONCLUSION: Transplantation surgery in children produces a significant risk of ocular impairment. The 1-year complication rate was 16.0%. Eye surgery may be required within the first few years after transplantation. Although most patients maintained a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, one patient became bilaterally legally blind.","tags":null,"title":"Ocular complications after organ and bone marrow transplantation in children","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rob Lemanske","Dan Jackson","Ronald Gangnon","Mike Evans","Zhanhai Li","Peter Shult","Carol Kirk","Erik Reisdorf","Kathy Roberg","Beth Anderson","Kirstin Carlson-Dakes","Kiva Adler","Stephanie Gilbertson-White","Tressa Pappas","Douglas Dasilva","Chris Tisler","Jim Gern"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1125532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1125532800,"objectID":"5934f062d316171897ef9aead45fd1f9","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/lemanske-2005/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.798352Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lemanske-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: The contribution of viral respiratory infections during infancy to the development of subsequent wheezing and/or allergic diseases in early childhood is not established.

METHODS:\nWe performed a nested case-control study to evaluate the epidemiology of candiduria in renal transplant recipients at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) over an 8-year period. RESULTS:\nRenal transplantations were performed on 1738 patients during this period, 192 of whom had 276 episodes of candiduria. Candida glabrata, which was recovered from 98 (51%) of 192 case patients, was the most common pathogen identified. Most case patients were asymptomatic. Independent predictors of candiduria were female sex (odds ratio [OR], 12.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7-23.0), intensive care unit admission (OR, 8.8; 95% CI, 2.3-35.0), antibiotic use during the month before candiduria (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.3), presence of an indwelling bladder catheter (OR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.1-9.4), diabetes (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3-3.9), neurogenic bladder (OR, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.1-27), and malnutrition (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.4). Log-rank testing of Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that 60-day, 90-day, and cumulative survival rates were significantly different between case and control patients; there was no difference in the survival rate during the first 30 days after transplantation. A variety of regimens were used for treatment; 119 case patients (62%) underwent removal of the indwelling bladder catheter within 1 week after diagnosis of candiduria. Candiduria cleared in 148 case patients (77%). Treatment of candiduria was not associated with an improved survival rate. CONCLUSIONS:\nCandiduria occurs commonly in renal transplant recipients. Risk factors for candiduria in such persons are similar to those in hospitalized patients who have not received a transplant. Candiduria is associated with reduced survival rates among persons who have undergone renal transplantation; this is likely a marker for severity of illness.

As a result, the femur neck and trochanter T-scores were lowered, and osteoporosis prevalence was increased. Use of a recalculated young-normal SD for the GE Lunar-adjusted NHANES III database improved diagnostic agreement and is recommended. INTRODUCTION: Use of manufacturer-specific normative databases for T-score derivation leads to discordance in T-score values and differences in diagnostic classification. To address this issue, the International Committee for Standards in Bone Measurement (ICSBM) recommended the NHANES III database for femur T-score derivation. Acquired on Hologic (Hol) instruments, this database requires conversion equations for application to other DXA systems. NHANES III total femur (TF) conversions for GE Lunar (GE) have previously been available, and femoral neck (FN) and trochanter (TR) equations were reported recently. Per the ICSBM recommendation, GE Lunar incorporated these values into their female database. This should produce T-score and diagnostic agreement between Hol and GE instruments; however, this has not been evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared GE femur scans in 115 postmenopausal women using software before and after the NHANES III software update. Subsequently, T-scores derived from femur scans obtained on GE and Hol densitometers were compared in a different group of 89 postmenopausal women. RESULTS: The NHANES III software update had no effect on measured BMD (g/cm2) at any femur region. However, because of changes in values used for T-score calculation (increase in the mean young-normal BMD at the FN and TR and a reduction in SD at the TR), the T-scores were lower (mean, 0.48 and 0.68, respectively) at the FN and TR using post-NHANES III software. Consequently, this update increased femur osteoporosis prevalence in these 115 women from 7.8% to 18.3%.

Post-swallow residue at four locations, Penetration/Aspiration Scale scores, and three bolus flow timing measures were assessed videofluoroscopically with respect to age and bolus condition. The only statistically significant influences attributable to the presence of the pressure sensors were slight increases in residue in the oral cavity and upper esophageal sphincter with some bolus consistencies, 8% more frequent trace penetration of the laryngeal vestibule predominantly with effortful swallowing, and variances in oral clearance duration.

METHODS:\nWe reviewed the medical records of 13 consecutive patients (13 eyes) with macular edema associated with CRVO who were treated with an injection of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (4 mg) at the University of Wisconsin and the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. Each intravitreal injection was delivered through the pars plana using a 27- or 30-gauge needle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nChange in Snellen visual acuity, clinical appearance of macular edema, measurement of foveal thickening with optical coherence tomography (OCT), and frequency of complications. RESULTS:\nThe median age of the 13 patients was 67 years (interquartile range, 57-77 years), and the median duration of symptoms before injection was 8 months (interquartile range, 4-9 months). Mean baseline visual acuity was 20/500 in the affected eye. Mean visual acuity at the 6-month follow-up examination was 20/180 in the affected eye. All 13 patients completed the 6-month examination. Eyes with nonischemic CRVO (n = 5) demonstrated a significant improvement in visual acuity, whereas eyes with ischemic CRVO (n = 8) demonstrated a nonsignificant visual acuity improvement. No patient had a decrease in visual acuity. Mean baseline foveal thickness as measured by OCT was 590 micro m (retinal thickening = 416 micro m). Mean foveal thickness as measured by OCT at the 1-month follow-up examination in 12 patients was 212 micro m (retinal thickening = 38 micro m). At the 3-month follow-up examination, mean foveal thickness as measured by OCT for 13 patients was 193 micro m (retinal thickening = 19 micro m). Between the 3- and 6-month follow-up examinations, 4 patients developed a recurrence of macular edema. Three of the 4 patients were retreated with a second injection of triamcinolone. Two of these 3 patients experienced an improvement in visual acuity following retreatment. At the 6-month follow-up examination, mean foveal thickness as measured by OCT for 13 patients was 281 micro m (retinal thickening = 107 micro m). No adverse effects such as retinal detachment or endophthalmitis occurred. One patient experienced an increase in intraocular pressure that was controlled with 2 aqueous suppressants. CONCLUSIONS:\nIntravitreal injection of triamcinolone appears to be a possibly effective treatment in some patients with macular edema associated with CRVO. Patients with nonischemic CRVO may respond more favorably than patients with ischemic CRVO, and retreatment may be necessary in some patients.

During that study, it was noted that some of these patients had switched from etanercept to infliximab. In this study, we compared the response of subjects switching from etanercept to infliximab (n = 20) to that of subjects receiving infliximab with no prior tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy (n = 73).

Our findings suggest that clinical response may differ between anti-TNF agents, and lack of response to one agent may not predict a lack of response to another.","tags":null,"title":"The efficacy of switching from etanercept to infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pat Kokotailo","Judith Egan","Ronald Gangnon","David Brown","Marlon Mundt","Mike Fleming"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1086048000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1086048000,"objectID":"272208d4c48d71ac6071ce0d695e64ca","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/kokotailo-2004/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.803994Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kokotailo-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nHigh-risk alcohol use among college students is associated with accidents, partner violence, unwanted sexual encounters, tobacco use, and performance issues. The identification and treatment of high-risk drinking students is a priority for many college campuses and college health centers. The goal of this study was to test the psychometric properties of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) in college students. METHODS:\nA convenience sample of students coming into a college health clinic was asked to complete the 10-question AUDIT and then participate in a research interview. The interview focused on assessing students for alcohol abuse and dependence by using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Substance Abuse Module and timeline follow-back procedures to assess a 28-day drinking history. RESULTS:\nA total of 302 students met the eligibility criteria and agreed to participate in the study. The sample consisted of 185 females (61%) and 117 males (39%), with a mean age of 20.3 years. Forty students were abstinent, 88 were high-risk drinkers, and 103 met criteria for a 12-month history of dependence. Receiver operator curves demonstrated that the AUDIT had the highest area under the cure for detecting high-risk alcohol use (0.872) and the lowest for identifying persons with a lifetime history of alcohol abuse or dependence (0.775). An AUDIT cutoff score of 6 or greater demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.0% and a specificity of 60.0% in the detection of high-risk drinkers. CONCLUSIONS:\nThe AUDIT has reasonable psychometric properties in sample of college students using student health services. This study supports the use of the AUDIT in this population.","tags":null,"title":"Validity of the alcohol use disorders identification test in college students","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Hoffjan","Irina Ostrovnaja","Dan Nicolae","Dina Newman","Raluca Nicolae","Ronald Gangnon","Lori Steiner","Karen Walker","Rebecca Reynolds","Deborah Greene","Daniel Mirel","Jim Gern","Rob Lemanske","Carole Ober"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1078099200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1078099200,"objectID":"4587298152c4e9a5e09f4f28e3f8efb0","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/hoffjan-2004/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.806517Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hoffjan-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND:\nAsthma is a chronic respiratory disease that often originates in early childhood. Although candidate gene studies have identified many potential asthma susceptibility genes in adult populations, few have studied associations with immune phenotypes in the first year that might be early clinical markers of asthma. OBJECTIVE:\nThe aim of this study was to assess the contribution of genetic variation to cytokine response profiles and atopic phenotypes in the first year of life in the Childhood Origin of Asthma cohort. METHODS:\nTwo hundred seven European American children participating in the Childhood Origin of Asthma study were genotyped for 61 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 35 genes involved in immune regulation. We examined the relationship between these single nucleotide polymorphisms and PHA-induced cytokine (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma) response profiles at birth and at year 1, respiratory syncytial virus-induced wheezing and atopic dermatitis in the first year of life, and total IgE levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, and allergic sensitization at age 1 year. The data were analyzed by using censored regression for quantitative measurements and logistic regression for qualitative phenotypes. RESULTS:\nThe 237Gly allele of the high-affinity IgE receptor beta chain (FCER1B) and a silent substitution in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)2A gene were associated with reduced IL-13 responses in cord blood (P = .0025 and P = .0062, respectively). A significant gene-gene interaction between FCER1B 237Gly and NOS2A D346D was detected, with individuals carrying the minor allele for both polymorphisms having the lowest cord blood IL-13 levels. Furthermore, the IL13 110Gln allele showed an association with increased IgE levels at year 1 (P = .0026), and the colony-stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) 117Thr allele showed an association with a greater increase in IL-5 responses during the first year (P = .0092). The TGF-beta1 (TGFB1) -509T allele was associated with respiratory syncytial virus-related wheezing in the first year (P = .0005). None of the polymorphisms included in this study were associated with atopic dermatitis during the first year or a positive RAST result at 1 year of age. CONCLUSION:\nThese data suggest that variations in genes involved in immune regulation are associated with biologic and clinical phenotypes in the first year of life that might increase the risk for the subsequent development of childhood asthma.","tags":null,"title":"Genetic variation in immunoregulatory pathways and atopic phenotypes in infancy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jim Gern","Claudia Reardon","Sabine Hoffjan","Dan Nicolae","Zhanhai Li","Kathy Roberg","William Neaville","Kirstin Carlson-Dakes","Kiva Adler","Rebekah Hamilton","Beth Anderson","Stephanie Gilbertson-White","Chris Tisler","Douglas Dasilva","Kelly Anklam","Lance Mikus","Louis Rosenthal","Carole Ober","Ronald Gangnon","Rob Lemanske"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1075593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1075593600,"objectID":"5ea21a3132774df56ad1b3584064623b","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/gern-2004/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.807907Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gern-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: Exposure to furred pets might confer protection against the development of allergic sensitization through a mechanism that is incompletely understood.

OBJECTIVE:\nCytokine-response profiles were prospectively analyzed over the first year of life and compared with the clinical and immunologic expressions of atopy. METHODS:\nUmbilical cord and 1-year PBMCs were obtained from 285 subjects from allergic families. PHA-stimulated cytokine-response profiles (IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and IFN-gamma) were compared with blood eosinophil counts and total and specific IgE levels (dust mites, cat, egg, Alternaria species, peanut, milk, and dog) at age 1 year and at the development of atopic dermatitis and food allergy. RESULTS:\nFor the cohort as a whole, cytokine responses did not evolve according to a strict TH1 or TH2 polarization pattern. PHA-stimulated cord blood cells secreted low levels of IL-5 (2.1 pg/mL), moderate levels of IFN-gamma (57.4 pg/mL), and greater amounts of IL-13 (281.8 pg/mL). From birth to 1 year, IL-5 responses dramatically increased, whereas IL-13 and IFN-gamma responses significantly decreased. Reduced cord blood secretion of IL-10 and IFN-gamma was associated with subsequent sensitization to egg. In addition, there was evidence of TH2 polarization (increased IL-5 and IL-13 levels) associated with blood eosinophilia and increased total IgE levels by age 1 year.

Recent studies demonstrated that in Caucasians, blue-eyed, gray-eyed, and hazel-eyed individuals have comparable numbers of iris melanocytes. The present investigation was carried out to compare melanocyte numbers in the irides of Asian, African American, and Caucasian brown-eyed individuals. METHODS:\nParaffin-embedded sections from 71 brown-colored irides were incubated with rabbit anti-cow antibody against S100a, linked with an FITC conjugate antibody, and counterstained with Evans blue. Cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope and scored as melanocytes or other cells. Cell number, density, and iris area were calculated for each specimen. RESULTS:\nCaucasian and African American irides had comparable mean total melanocyte numbers. Asian irides had fewer total melanocytes than African American (P = .042) and Caucasian (P = .001) irides and smaller total number of cells (ie, melanocytes plus other cells) than African American (P = .054) or Caucasian (P = .009) irides. CONCLUSIONS:\nThere is a statistically significant smaller mean total melanocyte number and mean total cellularity in Asian irides as compared to Caucasian and African American irides. This difference appears to be due to the combination of smaller iris area and lower melanocyte density in the Asian irides.

However, other larger studies have reported a protective effect or no association.\nObjective To determine whether antibiotic therapy for E coli O157:H7 enteritis increases the risk of HUS.\nData Sources PubMed and MEDLINE computer searches were performed for studies published from January 1983 to February 2001 using the key words hemolytic uremic syndrome, risk factor, antibiotics, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Reference lists of relevant publications were reviewed, and 12 experts in the field were contacted to identify additional reports. No language restrictions were applied to the search.\nStudy Selection Studies were included if they reported a series of patients with documented E coli O157:H7 enteritis, some of whom developed HUS; had clear definitions of HUS; and had adequate data delineating the relationship between antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of HUS. Nine of the 26 identified studies fulfilled these criteria.\nData Extraction Two authors (N.S. and A.S.) independently reviewed each report identified by the searches and recorded predetermined information relevant to the inclusion criteria. A pooled odds ratio was calculated using a fixed-effects model, with assessment of heterogeneity among the studies.\nData Synthesis The pooled odds ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.68), indicating that there does not appear to be an increased risk of HUS with antibiotic treatment of E coli O157:H7 enteritis. Incomplete reporting of data in individual studies precluded adjustment for severity of illness.\nConclusion Our meta-analysis did not show a higher risk of HUS associated with antibiotic administration.

We examined the relationship between inner wall pore characteristics and outflow facility in living primate eyes in which facility had been pharmacologically increased by ethacrynic acid (ECA) infusion and in contralateral control eyes. METHODS: Outflow facility (two-level constant pressure perfusion) was measured in eight pairs of living monkey eyes before and after administration of a bolus dose of either 0.125 mM ECA or vehicle. After exsanguination, eyes were fixed in situ under constant-pressure conditions (mean fixation pressure approximately 19 mm Hg). The density and diameter of inner wall pores and the number and area of platelet aggregates on the inner wall of Schlemm's canal were measured by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: In ECA-treated eyes, outflow facility increased 63% (P or = 1.90 microm) intercellular pores was seen in ECA-treated eyes. The density of intracellular pores increased with the duration of fixative perfusion. Other than a weak negative correlation between outflow facility and intracellular pore density in ECA-treated eyes (P = 0.052), facility was not correlated with inner wall pore features. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are most consistent with a scenario in which ECA promotes formation of large intercellular pores in the inner wall of Schlemm's canal, which are then masked by platelet aggregates. Masking of intercellular pores, combined with fixation-induced alteration of inner wall pore density, greatly complicates attempts to relate facility to inner wall structure and suggests that in vivo pore density is smaller than in fixed tissue. Additionally, facility-influencing effects of ECA on the juxtacanalicular tissue cannot be excluded.","tags":null,"title":"Enthacrynic and acid effects on inner wall pores in living monkeys","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jennifer Peterson","Baohe Tian","Alexander Bershadsky","Tova Volberg","Ronald Gangnon","Ilan Spector","Benjamin Geiger","Paul Kaufman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":922924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":922924800,"objectID":"41eebf7a1103345e65a30030e8ec37a8","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/peterson-1999/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.815127Z","relpermalink":"/publication/peterson-1999/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nTo determine the effect of Latrunculin (LAT)-A, a macrolide that binds to G-actin, which leads to the disassembly of actin filaments, on shape, junctions, and the cytoskeleton of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and on outflow facility in living monkeys. METHODS:\nLatrunculin-A dose-time-response relationships in BAECs were determined by immunofluorescence and phase contrast light microscopy, facility by two-level constant pressure anterior chamber perfusion. RESULTS:\nIn BAECs, LAT-A caused dose- and incubation time- dependent destruction of actin bundles, cell separation, and cell loss. Cell-cell adhesions were more sensitive than focal contacts. Recovery was also dose- and time-dependent. In monkeys, exchange intracameral infusion and topical application of LAT-A induced dose- and time-dependent several-fold facility increases. The facility increase was completely reversed within several hours after drug removal. However, for at least 24 hours after a single topical LAT-A dose, perfusion with drug-free solution caused an accelerated increase in facility beyond that attributed to normal resistance washout. CONCLUSIONS:\nPharmacological disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in the trabecular meshwork by specific actin inhibitors like LAT-A may be a useful antiglaucoma strategy.","tags":null,"title":"Latrunculin-A increases outflow facility in the monkey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L Pratt","L Waschbusch","Bill Ladd","Ronald Gangnon","S Hendricks"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":920246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":920246400,"objectID":"2743d2cc1d48edf24a50b10d1a8f7c32","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/pratt-1999/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.8145Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pratt-1999/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To identify potential neonatal benefits and possible neonatal and maternal complications associated with repeated use of antenatal corticosteroids.

DESIGN:\nA retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS:\nA total of 289 eyes in 179 patients with narrow occludable angles (NOA) (N = 148), open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OAG) (N = 115), or chronic-angle closure glaucoma (CACG) (N = 26) were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:\nThe difference between preoperative and postoperative IOP, absolute postoperative IOP, and the need for acute IOP-lowering treatment was noted. RESULTS:\nOnly 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03%-5.8%; 1 of 94) of patients and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.02%-3.7%; 1 of 148) of eyes with NOA experienced a rise of more than 10 mmHg 1 to 2 hours after LPI. The incidence of postoperative IOP greater than 25 mmHg and acute postoperative IOP-lowering management was 0% (95% CI, 0%-3.8%). Intraocular pressure in 1 of 115 eyes (0.9%, 95% CI, 0.02%-4.7%) with OAG rose more than 10 mmHg, requiring acute treatment. None of the 26 CACG eyes experienced a rise of more than 10 mmHg (95% CI, 0%-13.2%). CONCLUSION:\nThe IOP rise that requires further intervention after LPI with the perioperative use of pilocarpine and apraclonidine is very uncommon.

METHODS: A consecutive series of all 68 patients who underwent trabeculectomy with MMC was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier life-table statistics and compared with other published retrospective analyses. RESULTS: At 2- and 3-year follow-up examinations, 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44-70%) and 47% (95% CI, 32-61%) of patients, respectively, avoided an intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 21 mmHg or less than 20% below their preoperative level without glaucoma medication on two consecutive occasions more than 1 month apart after 3 months follow-up (75% [95% CI, 60-84%] and 70% [95% CI, 53-81%], respectively, with medication) and avoided additional glaucoma surgery. Loss of more than three lines of visual acuity on two occasions more than 1 month apart after 3 months follow-up occurred in 28% of patients ( 2 lines in 44%) at 3 years. Nonreversible causes of loss of three lines of acuity occurred in 13% of patients. Complications requiring reoperation occurred in 16% of patients and included hypotony maculopathy (4%) and late bleb leaks (4%). CONCLUSIONS: At the 3-year follow-up evaluation, trabeculectomy with MMC provided an approximately 50% chance of maintaining IOPs less than 21 mmHg and a more than 20% IOP reduction without concomitant use of glaucoma medication, which increased to 70% with the addition of medication. This procedure was associated with an approximately 30% risk of substantial visual loss (approximately 15% nonreversible) and a 15% chance of reoperation for complications.","tags":null,"title":"Trabeculectomy with mitomycin C: intermediate-term results","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Todd Perkins","Ronald Gangnon","Bill Ladd","Paul Kaufman","C Libby"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":891388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":891388800,"objectID":"b32cb8cd55c6bc896c472a998f2edca3","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/perkins-1998a/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.817112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/perkins-1998a/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE:\nThe authors examine the intermediate-term effects of adjunctive intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) in a cohort of patients who received double-plate Molteno implants for complicated glaucomas.

RESULTS:\nAt three years follow-up, 35% (95% confidence interval (CI), 15-57%) of patients who received MMC avoided failure criteria of intraocular pressure (IOP) less than 6 mm Hg or more than 21 mm Hg, addition of glaucoma medication, reoperation for glaucoma, or tube removal. Seventeen percent (95% CI, 4-37%) of patients in the control group at three years follow-up met similar criteria (p = 0.039). No late complications of tube erosion were seen in the MMC group.

METHODS:\nMultivariable Cox models were constructed to evaluate the strength and statistical significance of baseline risk factors for development of high-risk PDR and of SVLV. RESULTS:\nThe baseline characteristics identified as risk factors for high-risk PDR were increased severity of retinopathy, decreased visual acuity (or increased extent of macular edema), higher glycosylated hemoglobin, history of diabetic neuropathy, lower hematocrit, elevated triglycerides, lower serum albumin, and persons with mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy, younger age (or type 1 diabetes). The predominant risk factor for development of SVLV was the prior development of high-risk PDR. The only other clearly significant factor was decreased visual acuity at baseline. In the eyes that developed SVLV before high-risk proliferative retinopathy was observed, baseline risk factors were decreased visual acuity (or increased extent of macular edema), older age (or type 2 diabetes), and female gender. CONCLUSIONS:\nThese analyses supported the view that the retinopathy-inhibiting effect of better glycemic control extends across all ages, both diabetes types, and all stages of retinopathy up to and including the severe nonproliferative and early proliferative stages and the possibility that reducing elevated blood lipids and treating anemia slow the progression of retinopathy.","tags":null,"title":"Risk factors for high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy and severe visual loss: Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Report #18","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pascal Imesch","Colleen Bindley","Zarir Khademian","Bill Ladd","Ronald Gangnon","Dan Albert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":828316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":828316800,"objectID":"d9c507dd78a9fe15a57b6e9710162fa1","permalink":"https://rgangnon.org/publication/imesch-1996/","publishdate":"2020-02-08T06:30:32.811979Z","relpermalink":"/publication/imesch-1996/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: To quantitatively associate iris color with melanocyte pigment content.
