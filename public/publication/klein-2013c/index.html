To describe the relationships of risk alleles in complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) to the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) during a 20-year period. METHODS:
There were 4282 persons aged 43 to 86 years at the baseline examination in 1988-1990 enrolled in a population-based cohort study who participated in at least 1 examination spaced 5 years apart during a 20-year period and had gradable fundus photographs for AMD and genotype information on CFH and ARMS2. Low, intermediate, and high genetic risk for AMD was defined by the presence of 0 to 1, 2, or 3 to 4 risk alleles for CFH and ARMS2, respectively. Multistate models were used to estimate the progression of AMD throughout the entire age range. RESULTS:
There were 2820 (66%), 1129 (26%), and 333 persons (8%) with low, intermediate, and high genetic risk for AMD, respectively. The 5-year incidences of early and late AMD were 9.1% and 1.6%, respectively, and increased with age but did not differ significantly by sex. Using the multistate model, of persons aged 45 years with no AMD in the low, intermediate, and high AMD genetic risk groups, 33.0%, 39.9%, and 46.5%, respectively, were estimated to develop early AMD, and 1.4%, 5.2%, and 15.3% were estimated to develop late AMD by age 80 years. CONCLUSIONS:
These population-based data provide estimates of the long-term risk of the incidence and progression of AMD and its lesions by age and genetic risk alleles for CFH and ARMS2. They also show that when early AMD is present, knowing the phenotype contributes more to risk assessment than knowing the genetic risk based on these 2 AMD genes.">
