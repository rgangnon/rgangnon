To examine the association of current cigarette smoking and pack-years smoked with the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to examine the interactions of current smoking and pack-years smoked with complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) genotype. DESIGN:
A longitudinal population-based study of AMD in a representative American community. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period. PARTICIPANTS:
A total of 4439 participants in the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES). METHODS:
Age-related macular degeneration status was determined from grading retinal photographs. Multi-state models were used to model the relationship of current smoking and pack-years smoked and interactions with CFH and ARMS2 with the incidence and progression of AMD over the entire age range. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Incidence and progression of AMD over a 20-year period and interactions between current smoking and pack-years smoked with CFH and ARMS2 genotype. RESULTS:
The incidence of early AMD over the 20-year period was 24.4%, and the incidence of late AMD was 4.5%. Current smoking was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from minimal to moderate early AMD. A greater number of pack-years smoked was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from no AMD to minimal early AMD and from severe early AMD to late AMD. Current smoking and a greater number of pack-years smoked were associated with an increased risk of death. There were no statistically significant multiplicative interactions between current smoking or pack-years smoked and CFH or ARMS2 genotype. CONCLUSIONS:
Current smoking and a greater number of pack-years smoked increase the risk of the progression of AMD. This has important health care implications because smoking is a modifiable behavior.">

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract">PURPOSE:
To examine the association of current cigarette smoking and pack-years smoked with the incidence and progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to examine the interactions of current smoking and pack-years smoked with complement factor H (CFH, rs1061170) and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2, rs10490924) genotype. DESIGN:
A longitudinal population-based study of AMD in a representative American community. Examinations were performed every 5 years over a 20-year period. PARTICIPANTS:
A total of 4439 participants in the population-based Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES). METHODS:
Age-related macular degeneration status was determined from grading retinal photographs. Multi-state models were used to model the relationship of current smoking and pack-years smoked and interactions with CFH and ARMS2 with the incidence and progression of AMD over the entire age range. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Incidence and progression of AMD over a 20-year period and interactions between current smoking and pack-years smoked with CFH and ARMS2 genotype. RESULTS:
The incidence of early AMD over the 20-year period was 24.4%, and the incidence of late AMD was 4.5%. Current smoking was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from minimal to moderate early AMD. A greater number of pack-years smoked was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from no AMD to minimal early AMD and from severe early AMD to late AMD.

There were no statistically significant multiplicative interactions between current smoking or pack-years smoked and CFH or ARMS2 genotype. CONCLUSIONS:
Current smoking and a greater number of pack-years smoked increase the risk of the progression of AMD. This has important health care implications because smoking is a modifiable behavior.</p>
