abstract: "We consider methods proposed for detecting localized spatial clustering. We propose a new test statistic, the weighted average likelihood ratio test, as an alternative to the spatial scan (maximum likelihood ratio) test statistic. Two different types of weights are considered. We propose an unbiased cluster selection criterion and evaluate the bias of the tests through simulation. We also examine the power of the tests through simulations and apply the methods to the well-known New York leukaemia data."
