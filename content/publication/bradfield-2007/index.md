abstract: "OBJECTIVE:

To determine if sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity is predictive of recognition acuity in children with albinism.
METHODS:

A retrospective review was performed in children with albinism who underwent sweep VEP testing from 1992 to 2003. All patients had a complete ophthalmologic examination with either binocular or monocular sweep VEP testing and at least 5 years of follow-up. Positive predictability of sweep VEP acuity was defined as final recognition acuity within 1 Snellen line of initial sweep VEP acuity.
RESULTS:

Of the 13 patients included in the study, 11 had nystagmus, iris transillumination defects, and foveal hypoplasia at initial examination. The mean age at initial sweep VEP testing was 3.1 years (range, 0.1-10.0 years). Five of 13 patients had initial sweep VEP acuity that was predictive of final recognition acuity. Five additional patients had final recognition acuity, which surpassed initial sweep VEP acuity by 2 to 3 lines. Of these 10 patients, the mean duration for recognition acuity to reach VEP acuity was 5.4 years. There was no correlation between predictive VEP acuity and foveal pigmentation, refractive error, strabismus, nystagmus, or longer follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS:

Sweep VEP testing can be used as a predictive tool for recognition acuity in children with albinism. Predictability was found in a clinical spectrum of albinism."
