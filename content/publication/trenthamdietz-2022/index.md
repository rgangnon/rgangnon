abstract: "Purposeof Review This review highlights six “best practices” for cancer epidemiology coordinating centers to facilitate the
success of a research consortium.
Recent Findings Evidence from emerging literature regarding the Science of Team Science suggests that coordinating centers
can more effectively foster collaborative cancer epidemiology research in consortia by (1) establishing collaboration as a
shared goal at the start, (2) providing scientific expertise complementary to the research sites that adapts over the course of
the project, (3) enacting anti-racist and inclusive approaches in all consortium decisions and activities, (4) fostering earlystage
investigator career development, (5) engaging stakeholders including cancer survivors as peers, and (6) delivering
reliable logistical support and technology tools with planned process evaluation so that researchers can collaboratively focus
on the science.
Summary By drawing on the Science of Team Science, coordinating centers can accelerate research progress and increase
the impact of cancer epidemiology consortia."
