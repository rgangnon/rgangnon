abstract: "Background: Studies indicate that the nasal microbiome may correlate strongly with
the presence or future risk of childhood asthma.

Objectives: In this study, we tested whether developmental trajectories of the
nasopharyngeal microbiome in early life and the composition of the microbiome during
illnesses were related to risk of childhood asthma.

Methods: Children participating in the Childhood Origins of Asthma study (n=285)
provided nasopharyngeal mucus samples in the first two years of life, during routine
healthy study visits (2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months of age) and episodes of respiratory
illnesses, which were analyzed for respiratory viruses and bacteria. We identified
developmental trajectories of early-life microbiome composition, as well as predominant
bacteria during respiratory illnesses, and correlated these with presence of asthma at 6,
8, 11, 13 and 18 years of age.

Results: Of the four microbiome trajectories identified, a Staphylococcus-dominant
microbiome in the first 6 months of life was associated with increased risk of recurrent
wheezing by age 3 years and asthma that persisted throughout childhood. In addition,
this trajectory was associated with the early onset of allergic sensitization. During
wheezing illnesses, detection of rhinoviruses and predominance of Moraxella were
associated with asthma that persisted throughout later childhood.

Conclusion: In infancy, the developmental composition of the microbiome during
healthy periods and the predominant microbes during acute wheezing illnesses are both
associated with the subsequent risk of developing persistent childhood asthma. "
