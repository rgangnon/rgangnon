abstract: "Purpose Physical activity (pre- and post-diagnosis) has been studied in prevention and survivorship contexts for endometrial
cancer. However, the association of physical activity (PA) across the lifespan on mortality risk among endometrial cancer
survivors is understudied. The study’s objective was to identify the association of lifetime PA on mortality risk in endometrial
cancer survivors.
Methods Seven hundred forty-five endometrial cancer survivors drawn from a population-based cancer registry (diagnosed
between 1991 and 1994) reported the frequency (sessions/week) of moderate- and vigorous intensity physical activity
(MVPA) at age 12, age 20, and 5 years pre-interview (post-diagnosis). Cox proportional hazards were used to estimate hazard
ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for the association between PA, all-cause, and cardiovascular disease mortality as
assessed in 2016. MVPA was modeled using natural cubic splines.
Results Diagnosis age, body mass index, and smoking (pack-years) were each positively associated with increased all-cause
mortality risk. Those who did one session of MVPA 5 years pre-interview had a lower mortality risk (HR 0.61; 95% CI
0.41–0.92) compared to those with no MVPA. Those reporting one session of MVPA was similarly observed at age 12 (HR
0.95; 95% CI 0.86–1.06) and at age 20 (HR 0.87; 95% CI 0.65–1.16).
Conclusion Those who participated in PA, compared to those who did not, in the 5 years before diagnosis had a lower
mortality risk. While PA was not independently protective against mortality risk at ages 12 or 20, PA is still important for
endometrial cancer survivors for other non-mortality outcomes."
