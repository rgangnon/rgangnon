abstract: "Background: Screening mammography guidelines do not
explicitly consider racial differences in breast cancer epidemiology,
treatment, and survival.
Objective: To compare tradeoffs of screening strategies in
Black women versus White women under current guidelines.
Design: An established model from the Cancer Intervention
and Surveillance Modeling Network simulated screening outcomes
using race-specific inputs for subtype distribution;
breast density; mammography performance; age-, stage-,
and subtype-specific treatment effects; and non–breast cancer
mortality.
Setting: United States.
Participants: A 1980 U.S. birth cohort of Black and White
women.
Intervention: Screening strategies until age 74 years with
varying initiation ages and intervals.
Measurements: Outcomes included benefits (life-years
gained [LYG], breast cancer deaths averted, and mortality
reduction), harms (mammographies, false positives, and
overdiagnoses), and benefit–harm ratios (tradeoffs) by race.
Efficiency (benefits per unit resource), mortality disparity
reduction, and equity in tradeoffs were evaluated. Equitable
strategies for Black women were defined as those with 
tradeoffs closest to benchmark values for screening White
women biennially from ages 50 to 74 years.
Results: Biennial screening from ages 45 to 74 years was
most efficient for Black women, whereas biennial screening
from ages 40 to 74 years was most equitable. Initiating
screening 10 years earlier in Black versus White women
reduced Black–White mortality disparities by 57% with similar
LYG per mammogram for both populations. Selection of the
most equitable strategy was sensitive to assumptions about
disparities in real-world treatment effectiveness: The less
effective treatment was for Black women, the more intensively
Black women could be screened before tradeoffs fell
short of those experienced by White women.
Limitation: Single model.
Conclusion: Initiating biennial screening in Black women at
age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality disparities and
yields benefit–harm ratios that are similar to tradeoffs of
White women screened biennially from ages 50 to 74 years."
