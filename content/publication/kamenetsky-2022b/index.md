abstract: "Prior research has shown that cancer risk varies by geography, but scan statistic
methods for identifying cancer clusters in case-control studies have been limited in their
ability to identify multiple clusters and adjust for participant-level risk factors. We de-
velop a method to identify geographic patterns of breast cancer odds using the Wisconsin
Women's Health Study, a series of 5 population-based case-control studies of female Wis-
consin residents aged 20-79 enrolled in 1988-2004 (cases=16,076, controls=16,795). We
create sets of potential clusters by overlaying a 1 km grid over each county-neighborhood
and enumerating a series of overlapping circles. Using a two-step approach, we  t a penal-
ized binomial regression model to the number of cases and trials in each grid cell, penal-
izing all potential clusters by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso).
We use BIC to select the number of clusters, which are included in a participant-level lo-
gistic regression model. We identify 15 geographic clusters, resulting in 23 areas of unique
geographic odds ratios. After adjustment for known risk factors, con dence intervals nar-
rowed but breast cancer odds ratios did not meaningfully change; one additional hotspot
was identi ed. By considering multiple overlapping spatial clusters simultaneously, we
discern gradients of spatial odds across Wisconsin."
