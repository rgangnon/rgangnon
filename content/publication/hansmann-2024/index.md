abstract: "Objectives
To characterize the effect of the actual and potential ability to get rides from others on older adultsâ€™ driving reduction at three-year follow up in the United States.

Methods
We analyzed National Health and Aging Trends Study data from community-dwelling drivers in 2015 (unweighted n = 5,102). We used weighted logistic regression models to estimate whether getting rides from others in 2015 was associated with older adults increasing the number of driving behaviors they avoided, decreasing the frequency with which they drove, or not driving at three-year follow up after adjusting for biopsychosocial variables. We also measured presence of social network members living nearby including household and non-household members and estimated associated odds of driving reduction at three-year follow up.

Results
Older adults who got rides from others in 2015 had greater odds of reporting no longer driving at three-year follow up compared to those who did not get rides (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] = 1.53, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.11-2.11). We found no statistically significant association between older adults living with others or having more nearby confidantes outside their household and their odds of reducing driving at three-year follow up.

Discussion
These findings suggest that getting rides from others plays an important role in the transition to non-driving for older adults. Future research should examine whether other aspects of social networks (e.g., type, quality, closer proximity) might also be key modifiable coping factors for older adults transitioning to non-driving."
