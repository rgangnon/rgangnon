abstract: "Despite the known benefits of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for breast and endometrial
cancer survivors, most are insufficiently active, interventions response is heterogeneous, and MVPA
programming integration into cancer care is limited. A stepped care approach, in which the least resourceintensive intervention is delivered first and additional components are added based on individual
response, is one strategy to enhance uptake of physical activity programming. However, the most
effective intervention augmentation strategies are unknown. In this singly randomized trial of posttreatment, inactive breast and endometrial cancer survivors (n=323), participants receive a minimal intervention  including a Fitbit linked with their clinic’s patient portal and, in turn, the electronic health
record (EHR) with weekly feedback delivered via the portal. MVPA progress summaries are sent to
participants’ oncology team via the EHR. MVPA adherence is evaluated at 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks;
non-responders (those meeting ≤80% of the MVPA goal over previous 4 weeks) at each timepoint are
randomized once for the remainder of the 24-week intervention to one of two “step-up” conditions: (1)
online gym or (2) coaching calls, while responders continue with the minimal Fitbit+EHR intervention.
The primary outcome is ActiGraph-measured MVPA at 24 and 48 weeks. Secondary outcomes include
symptom burden and functional performance at 24 and 48 weeks. This trial will inform development of
an effective, scalable, and tailored intervention for survivors by identifying non-responders and providing
them with the intervention augmentations necessary to increase MVPA and improve health outcomes."
