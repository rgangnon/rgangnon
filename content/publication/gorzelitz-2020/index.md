abstract: "Background: The evidence base regarding validity of wearable fitness trackers for assessment and/or modification of physical
activity behavior is evolving. Accurate assessment of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) is important for
measuring adherence to physical activity guidelines in the United States and abroad. Therefore, this systematic review
synthesizes the state of the validation literature regarding wearable trackers and MVPA. Methods: A systematic search of
the PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted through October 2019 (PROSPERO
Q1 registration number: CRD42018103808). Studies were eligible if they reported on the validity of MVPA and used devices from
Fitbit, Apple, or Garmin released in 2012 or later or available on the market at the time of review. A meta-analysis was conducted
on the correlation measures comparing wearables with the ActiGraph. Results: Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria; all
used a Fitbit device; one included a Garmin model and no Apple-device studies were found. Moderate to high correlations (.7â€“.9)
were found between MVPA from the wearable tracker versus criterion measure (ActiGraph n = 14). Considerable heterogeneity
was seen with respect to the specific definition of MVPA for the criterion device, the statistical techniques used to assess validity,
and the correlations between wearable trackers and ActiGraph across studies. Conclusions: There is a need for standardization of
validation methods and reporting outcomes in individual studies to allow for comparability across the evidence base. Despite the
different methods utilized within studies, nearly all concluded that wearable trackers are valid for measuring MVPA."
