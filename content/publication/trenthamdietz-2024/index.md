abstract: "IMPORTANCE The effects of breast cancer incidence changes and advances in screening and
treatment on outcomes of different screening strategies are not well known.
OBJECTIVE To estimate outcomes of various mammography screening strategies.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION Comparison of outcomes using 6 Cancer Intervention
and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models and national data on breast cancer
incidence, mammography performance, treatment effects, and other-cause mortality in
US women without previous cancer diagnoses.
EXPOSURES Thirty-six screening strategies with varying start ages (40, 45, 50 years) and stop
ages (74, 79 years) with digital mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) annually,
biennially, or a combination of intervals. Strategies were evaluated for all women and for
Black women, assuming 100% screening adherence and “real-world” treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated lifetime benefits (breast cancer deaths averted,
percent reduction in breast cancer mortality, life-years gained), harms (false-positive recalls,
benign biopsies, overdiagnosis), and number of mammograms per 1000 women.
RESULTS Biennial screening with DBT starting at age 40, 45, or 50 years until age 74 years
averted a median of 8.2, 7.5, or 6.7 breast cancer deaths per 1000 women screened,
respectively, vs no screening. Biennial DBT screening at age 40 to 74 years (vs no screening)
was associated with a 30.0%breast cancer mortality reduction, 1376 false-positive recalls,
and 14 overdiagnosed cases per 1000 women screened. Digital mammography screening
benefits were similar to those for DBT but had more false-positive recalls. Annual screening
increased benefits but resulted in more false-positive recalls and overdiagnosed cases.
Benefit-to-harm ratios of continuing screening until age 79 years were similar or superior to
stopping at age 74. In all strategies, women with higher-than-average breast cancer risk,
higher breast density, and lower comorbidity level experienced greater screening benefits
than other groups. Annual screening of Black women from age 40 to 49 years with biennial
screening thereafter reduced breast cancer mortality disparities while maintaining similar
benefit-to-harm trade-offs as for all women.
CONCLUSIONS This modeling analysis suggests that biennial mammography screening starting
at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality and increases life-years gained per
mammogram. More intensive screening forwomen with greater risk of breast cancer diagnosis
or death can maintain similar benefit-to-harm trade-offs and reduce mortality disparities."
