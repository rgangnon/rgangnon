abstract: "We examined relationships between measures of adaptive behavior (AB), cognitive ability, and autism
symptom severity in 1,458 preschool-aged children with autism from the Study to Explore Early
Development. While publications commonly describe autistic children as “low-“ or “high-functioning”
based on cognitive ability, relying solely on cognitive scores may obscure meaningful variation in
functioning. We found significant heterogeneity in AB scores of children with cognitive scores both
above and below the threshold of two or more standard deviations below the population mean
specified in the diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability (ID). Although cognitive and AB scores were
strongly associated in our sample, considerable variation in overall AB and more than half in
socialization and motor skills was unaccounted for by cognitive ability, autism symptom severity, and
other covariates. Among children who could be designated “low-functioning” based on cognitive scores,
39.7% had composite AB scores indicating no significant delays, while among those who might be
designated “high-functioning,” 9.0% had significant delays in overall AB and 22.2% in socialization. These
results suggest AB scores capture variations in the autism phenotype not accounted for by other
measures we considered."
