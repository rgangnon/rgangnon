abstract: "Purpose Physical activity may greatly benefit
adults living with advanced cancer; however,
barriers to physical activity and preferences
for supportive care interventions are not well
understood. This study investigates barriers to
physical activity and differences in intervention
preferences by demographic and clinical
characteristics among adults with advanced
cancer.
Methods Data came from a cross-sectional
study of 247 adults with advanced cancer who
visited the University of Wisconsin Carbone
Cancer Centre from January 2021 to January
2023. The Godin–Shepard Leisure Score Index
(insufficiently active, moderately active and
active) was used to assess physical activity.
Physical activity barriers were reported as
mean scores (1–5: ‘not at all’ to ‘a great deal’).
Differences in intervention preferences were
assessed using X2 tests.
Results Adults living with advanced cancer
were insufficiently active (53%), moderately
active (21%) or active (26%). Respondents
identified several barriers to physical activity
spanning tiredness (x̄=3.2), winter weather
concerns (x̄=3.2) and lack of motivation
(x̄=2.7). Respondents were most interested in a
supportive care intervention designed to increase
energy (88%) and improve physical health (86%)
with physical therapy (73%), walking (72%)
and resistance exercises (72%). Differences
in preferences emerged by demographic
characteristics and to a lesser extent by clinical
characteristics.
Conclusions Adults with advanced cancer
reported several barriers to physical activity.
Future interventions should emphasise increasing
energy and physical health and include strategies
to manage tiredness and winter weather
concerns."
