abstract: "Background Innovative treatments have improved cancer survival but also increased financial hardship for patients. While
demographic factors associated with financial hardship among cancer survivors are known in the USA, the role of geography
is less clear.
Methods We evaluated prevalence of forgoing care due to cost within 12 months by US Census region (Northeast, North
Central/Midwest [NCMW], South, West) by demographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity) among 217,981 cancer survivors
aged 18 to 82 years from the 2015–2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. We summarized region- and
group-specific prevalence of forgoing physician visits due to cost and used multilevel logistic regression models to compare
regions.
Results The prevalence of forgoing physician visits due to cost was highest in the South (aged < 65 years: 19–38%; aged ≥ 65:
4–21%; adjusted odds ratios [OR], NCMW versus South, OR: 0.63 [0.56–0.71]; Northeast versus South, OR: 0.63 [0.55–
0.73]; West versus South, OR: 0.73 [0.64–0.84]). Across the USA, including regions with broad Medicaid expansion,
younger, female, and persons of color most often reported cost-related forgoing physician visits.
Conclusion Forgoing physician visits due to cost among cancer survivors is regionally clustered, raising concerns for concentrated
poor long-term cancer outcomes. Underlying factors likely include variation in regional population compositions
and contextual factors, such as Medicaid expansion and social policies. Disproportionate cost burden among survivors of
color in all regions highlight systemic barriers, underscoring the need to improve access to the entire spectrum of care for
cancer survivors, and especially for those most vulnerable."
