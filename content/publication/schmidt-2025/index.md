abstract: "Background and aims
Multimorbidity, defined as the presence of two or more chronic health conditions, is a growing problem in the United States and abroad. Physical activity is a modifiable health behavior that promotes physical and mental health, yet little is known about the relationship between physical activity and mental health among those with multimorbidity.
Methods
Using a population-based survey of community dwelling adults in Wisconsin, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW), we assessed the relationship between accelerometer-measured physical activity and self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with and without multimorbidity.
Results
Participants with multimorbidity were significantly more likely to have moderate to extremely severe levels of anxiety than those without multimorbidity (17.2% vs 10.5%, p < 0.001). One hour of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week was associated with decreased odds of anxiety of those with multimorbidity (0.86 [0.75, 0.99]). We also found a positive association between light intensity physical activity and a lower burden of depressive symptoms among those with one chronic condition (0.95 [0.93, 0.98]) or multimorbidity (0.97 [0.95, 1.00]), and lower odds of anxiety among those without chronic conditions (0.98 [0.95, 1.00]) or with only one chronic condition (0.95 [0.93, 0.98]).
Conclusions
Our study suggests that MVPA and light intensity physical activity may be associated with lower odds of elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms among those with and without multimorbidity. Further research is needed to identify populations, disease states, and condition clusters that may have the most potential benefit from light intensity activity and MVPA."
