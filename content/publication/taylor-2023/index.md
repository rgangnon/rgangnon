abstract: "Introduction: Rural patients with diabetic foot ulcers, especially those identifying as Black, face
increased risk of major amputation. Specialty care can reduce this risk. However, care
disparities might beget outcome disparities. We aimed to determine whether a smaller
proportion of rural patients, particularly those identifying as Black, receive specialty care
compared to the national proportion.

Research Design and Methods: This 100% national retrospective cohort examined Medicare
beneficiaries hospitalized with diabetic foot ulcers (2013â€“2014). We report observed differences
in specialty care, including: endocrinology, infectious disease, orthopedic surgery, plastic
surgery, podiatry, or vascular surgery. We used logistic regression to examine possible
intersectionality between rurality and race, controlling for sociodemographics, comorbidities, and
ulcer severity and including an interaction term between rurality and identifying as Black.

Results: Overall, 32.15% (n=124 487) of patients hospitalized with a diabetic foot ulcer received
specialty care. Among rural patients (n=13 100), the proportion decreased to 29.57%. For
patients identifying as Black (n=21 649), the proportion was 33.08%. Among rural patients
identifying as Black (n=1239), 26.23% received specialty care. This was >5 absolute percentage
points less than the overall cohort. The adjusted odds ratio for receiving specialty care among
rural versus urban patients identifying as Black was 0.61 (95% CI 0.53-0.71), which was lower
than that for rural versus urban patients identifying as White (aOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.89). This
metric supported a role for intersectionality between rurality and identifying as Black.

Conclusions: A smaller proportion of rural patients, particularly those identifying as Black,
received specialty care when hospitalized with a diabetic foot ulcer compared to the overall
cohort. This might contribute to known disparities in major amputations. Future studies are
needed to determine causality."
