abstract: "Spatial and spatio-temporal cluster detection are important tools in public health and
many other areas of application. Cluster detection can be approached as a multiple
testing problem, typically using a space and time scan statistic. We recast the spatial
and spatio-temporal cluster detection problem in a high-dimensional data analytical
framework with Poisson or quasi-Poisson regression with the Lasso penalty. We adopt
a fast and computationally-efficient method using a novel sparse matrix representation
of the effects of potential clusters. The number of clusters and tuning parameters are
selected based on (quasi-)information criteria. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed method including the false positive detection rate and power using a
simulation study. Application of the method is illustrated using breast cancer incidence
data from three prefectures in Japan."
