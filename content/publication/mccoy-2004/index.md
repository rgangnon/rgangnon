abstract: "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the preparative regimen of thiotepa and etoposide in patients undergoing autologous transplantation for relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The study involved 65 consecutive patients who underwent autologous transplantation using the thiotepa/etoposide regimen for relapsed intermediate-grade NHL at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics (UWHC) between 1987 and 2001. The regimen consisted of thiotepa 300 mg/m(2)/day and etoposide 700 mg/m(2)/day on days -6, -5, and -4. The median age at the time of transplant was 49 years. A total of 50 patients (76%) had diffuse large-cell lymphoma. A total of 50 (77%) patients had chemosensitive disease, and 15 (23%) were chemoresistant. With a median follow-up of 34 months (range, 3-163), 28 patients (43%) remain in CR and 33 (51%) have developed recurrent or progressive disease. The overall survival and event-free survival at 3 years are 40% (95% CI 26-53%) and 32% (95% CI 20-45%), respectively. There was one death attributed to regimen-related toxicity (RRT). Reversible gastrointestinal toxicity was the major RRT, and there was minimal pulmonary and cardiac toxicity. We conclude that the combination of thiotepa and etoposide is an effective preparative regimen with acceptable RRT."
