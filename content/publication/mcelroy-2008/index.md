abstract: "BACKGROUND:

Lead is a toxic nonessential metal with widespread exposure starting in utero. Lead has been reclassified in 2004 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group from a 'possible' to a 'probable' human carcinogen. Lead may be a facilitative or permissive carcinogen, which means that lead may permit or augment the genotoxic effects of other exposures.
METHODS:

This population-based study in Wisconsin gathered survey data and home-collected urine specimens from 246 women, ages 20 to 69 years, with incident invasive breast cancer identified from the Wisconsin state registry and 254 age-matched control subjects from population lists from September 2004 to February 2005. We measured urinary lead concentrations by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, adjusted the values by specific gravity, and conducted interviews by telephone to obtain information on known and suspected breast cancer risk factors.
RESULTS:

Women in the highest quartile of specific gravity-adjusted lead level (>=1.10 mug/L) had twice the breast cancer risk of those in the lowest quartile (<0.42 mug/L; odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.6) after adjustment for established risk factors. Excluding women who were currently taking nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (n = 52), we did not observe any increased breast cancer risk after adjustment for established risk factors.
CONCLUSION:

Our population-based case-control study suggests that lead exposure, as determined by specific gravity-adjusted urinary lead concentrations, is not associated with a significant increased risk for breast cancer."
