abstract: "Purpose
Physical activity (PA) is associated with better quality of life for cancer survivors; however, less is known about this association among individuals with advanced cancer. This study assesses whether changes in PA following an advanced cancer diagnosis are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes.

Methods
Data were collected from 247 participants in a survey of adults with advanced cancer who visited the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (January 2021–2023). PA since cancer diagnosis was assessed using a validated, self-reported tool. HRQoL was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures of physical function, fatigue, and pain interference. We used generalized linear models to assess relationships between PA and HRQoL.

Results
Most adults with advanced cancer were insufficiently active (53%), and reported a lot less activity (41%) after diagnosis, followed by a little less activity (33%), and the same/more activity (26%). Compared to the other activity groups, those who reported a lot less activity had the worst HRQoL scores, including lower HRQoL (x̄ = 70.3 vs. x̄ = 82.6, 90.7) and physical function (x̄ = 40.3 vs. x̄ = 47.3, 52.5), and higher fatigue (x̄ = 59.3 vs. x̄ = 51.4, 42.3) and pain interference (x̄ = 55.5 vs. x̄ = 48.8, 45.6).

Conclusions
Adults with advanced cancer who report PA reductions have worse HRQoL, higher pain and fatigue, and lower physical function than those engaging in the same/more PA since their diagnosis. Future interventions focused on improving HRQoL among adults with advanced cancer should incorporate light-intensity PA to reduce declines following diagnosis."
