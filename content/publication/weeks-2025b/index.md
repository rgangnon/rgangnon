abstract: "Introduction: The postpartum visit is an important opportunity to prevent pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality; however, about 1 in 10 birthing people fail to attend this visit. Intrapartum care experiences are an understudied factor that may contribute to postpartum healthcare engagement. 
Materials and Methods: We analyze data from a novel survey supplement on intrapartum care experiences administered to a probability-based population sample of people who have recently given birth through the Wisconsin Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System.  
Results: In regression models adjusting for a robust set of individual characteristics and birth hospital clustering, we find that lower provider responsiveness during intrapartum care is associated with increased odds of forgoing the postpartum visit (aOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0).
Discussion: The quality of care received during the birth hospitalization may shape how birthing people feel about health care providers and their willingness to attend future visits. Experiences of care during the intrapartum period may contribute to postpartum mental health outcomes and future health care utilization. Improving these experiences is an opportunity to promote long-term health.
