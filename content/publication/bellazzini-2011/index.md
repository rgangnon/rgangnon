abstract: "Introduction

Crew safety is paramount to successful helicopter emergency medical service transport. This study assesses using an online video to teach landing zone safety.
Methods

This is a randomized, prospective study using a 5-minute video to teach landing zone safety. A pre- and post-test were used to assess efficacy of the initial instruction and subsequent knowledge decay. Block randomization by EMS agency or fire department assigned participants to 0, 2, 4, or 6-month post-video testing.
Results

257 participants, including 62 EMTs, 114 firefighters, and 80 EMT/firefighters, were enrolled and randomized to immediate (A), 2-month (B), 4-month (C), and 6-month (D) post-video testing. 184 (71.6%) completed the study: A – 72 (93.5%), B – 27 (55.1%), C – 32 (64.0%), and D – 53 (65.4%). Mean scores (pre-test, post-test) were: A – (82.7%, 94.9%), B – (81.9%, 91.2%), C – (86.3%, 88%), and D – (82.6%, 92.2%). Statistically significant score increases were seen in groups A (11.1%, 95% CI 6.0%, 16.1%), B (9.0%, 95% CI 3.1%, 14.9%), and D (9.9%, 95% CI 5.3%, 14.5%). Group C had a mean increase of 2.3%, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.41).
Conclusion

Web-based media is an effective means of teaching landing zone safety to first responders with minimal knowledge decay."
