abstract: "Patterns in disease across space and time are important to epidemiologists and health professionals
because they may indicate underlying elevated disease risk. In some cases, elevated risk
may be driven by environmental exposures, infectious diseases or other factors where timely
public health interventions are important. The spatial and spatio-temporal scan statistics identify
a single most likely cluster or equivalently select a single correct model. We instead consider an
ensemble of single cluster models. We use stacking, a model-averaging technique, to combine
relative risk estimates from all of the single cluster models into a sequence of meta-models
indexed by the effective number of parameters/clusters. The number of parameters/spatiotemporal
clusters is chosen using information criteria. A simulation study is conducted to
demonstrate the statistical properties of the stacking method. The method is illustrated using a
dataset of female breast cancer incidence data at the municipality level in Japan."
