abstract: "Purpose: We assessed feasibility and satisfaction of the Active Children Through In-Home Web-Based Physical Activity pilot trial, delivering a web-based movement integration intervention to children. Method: Eighty-two children (8–11 y), insufficiently active, were randomly assigned to either exercise intervention (n = 41) or wait-list control (n = 41). The intervention involved 20-minute exercise videos, 5 times weekly for 12 weeks, using the UNICEF Kid Power website at home. Feasibility metrics included recruitment (target: 70%), retention (target: 80%), adherence rates, and satisfaction assessed through surveys and interviews. Retention rate-1 was percentage completing posttest surveys, and retention rate-2 was percentage completing posttest accelerometry. Parent logs assessed adherence. Results: Recruitment, retention-1, and retention-2 rates were 73.6%, 93.9%, and 80.5%, respectively. The intervention group had 5 dropouts; wait-list control had none. Sixty-nine percent showed high intervention adherence. Parents consistently expressed satisfaction, finding the intervention enjoyable and beneficial. Although children initially provided positive reviews, their interest declined over time, with increasing expressions of monotony. Suggestions to increase novelty and incorporate a social component were made by participants. The intervention was also found to be particularly useful during inclement weather. Conclusion: Active Children Through In-Home Web-Based Physical Activity trial exceeded feasibility targets of recruitment and retention and achieved moderate overall adherence. Future trials should emphasize novelty and peer participation for improved adherence and satisfaction."
