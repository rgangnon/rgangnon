abstract: "Objectives: We examined the association of exposure to maternal depression when a
child is age 3 with future child problem behavior and investigated whether
race/ethnicity is a moderator of this relationship.
Methods: We used Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study data (age 3 N=3288
and 49% Black, 26% Hispanic, 22% non-Hispanic White; age 5 N=3001 and 51%
Black, 25% Hispanic, 21% non-Hispanic White; age 9 N=3630 and 50% Black, 25%
Hispanic, 21% non-Hispanic White) and ordinal logistic regression to model problem
behavior at ages 3, 5, and 9 on maternal depression status at age 3.
Results: At age 9, children whose mother was depressed when the child was age 3
were significantly more likely to have higher internalizing (AOR=1.92, 95% CI:
1.42,2.61) and externalizing (AOR=1.65, 95% CI: 1.10,2.48) problem behavior scores.
Race/ethnicity did not have moderating effects, potentially due to a limitation of the
data that required use of maternal self-reported race/ethnicity as a proxy for child
race/ethnicity.
Conclusions for Practice: Exposure to maternal depression after the prenatal and perinatal periods may have a negative association with childrenâ€™s behavioral
development through age 9. Interventions that directly target maternal depression
during this time should be developed. Additional research is needed to further
elucidate the role of race/ethnicity in the relationship between maternal depression and
child problem behavior."
