I am a Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics](https://biostat.wisc.edu) and the [Department of Population Health Sciences](https://pophealth.wisc.edu) in the [School of Medicine and Public Health](https://med.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu). I have an affiliate appointment in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu).

I grew up in [Duluth, Minnesota](https://www.visitduluth.com/). He graduated from [East High School](https://www.isd709.org/duluth-east) in 1988. I received a BA in [Mathematics](https://scse.d.umn.edu/about/departments-and-programs/mathematics-statistics-department) and [Economics](https://lsbe.d.umn.edu/about/academic-departments/economics) in 1992 from the [University of Minnesota-Duluth](https://www.d.umn.edu/) and an [MS in Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/ms-program/) in 1994 and a [PhD in Statistics with emphasis in Biostatistics](https://stat.wisc.edu/graduate-studies/phd-program/) in 1998 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His PhD advisor was [Murray Clayton](https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/clayton-murray/).

I was a research scientist in the [Statistical Data Analysis Center(SDAC)](https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/research/clinical-trials/statistical-data-analysis-center/) in the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1998-2005.  I joined the faculty with a joint appointment in the [Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics](https://biostat.wisc.edu) and the [Department of Population Health Sciences](https://pophealth.wisc.edu) in 2005.

I am an applied biostatistician focusing on problems in clinical and epidemiologic research. Current methodologic areas of interest include (1) multi-state models for incidence, progression and regression of ocular (and other) diseases, (2) small area estimation problems, particularly ranking, (3) spatial and spatio-temporal modeling, particularly cluster detection and high-dimensional variable selection and (4) age-period-cohort modeling.
